        "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
        "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",

He invited, therefore, the spae-queen to his house, and prepared for her a hearty welcome, as was the custom whereever a reception was accorded a woman of this kind.

On her neck she had glass beads. On her head she had a black hood of lambskin, lined with ermine. A staff she had in her hand, with a knob thereon; it was ornamented with brass, and inlaid with gems round about the knob. Around her she wore a girdle of soft hair, and therein was a large skin-bag, in which she kept the talismans needful to her in her wisdom. She wore hairy calf-skin shoes on her feet, with long and strong-looking thongs to them, and great knobs of latten at the ends.

She remained silent altogether.\\n\\n During the evening the tables were set; and now I must tell you what food was made ready for the spae-queen. There was prepared for her porridge of kid's milk, and hearts of all kinds of living creatures there found were cooked for her.

She replied that she would not give answer before the morning, after she had slept there for the night.\\n\\nAnd when the (next) day was far spent, the preparations were made for her which she required for the exercise of her enchantments. She begged them to bring to her those women who were acquainted with the lore needed for the exercise of the enchantments, and which is known by the name of Weird-songs, but no such women came forward.

She was also liberal of her replies, and what she said proved true. After this came one from another homestead after her, and she then went there. Thorbjorn was invited, because he did not wish to remain at home while such heathen worship was performing.\\n\\nThe weather soon improved when once spring began, as Thorbjorg had said, Thorbjorn made ready his ship, and went on until he came to Brattahlid (the steep slope).

Once upon a time the king entered into conversation with Leif, and asked him, \"Dost thou purpose sailing to Greenland in summer?\"\\n\\nLeif answered, \"I should wish so to do, if it is your will.\" The king replied, \"I think it may well be so; thou shalt go my errand, and preach Christianity in Greenland.\"\\n\\nLeif said that he was willing to undertake it, but that, for himself, he considered that message a difficult one to proclaim in Greenland.

He was tossed about a long time out at sea, and lighted upon lands of which before he had no expectation. There were fields of wild wheat, and the vine-tree in full growth. There were also the trees which were called maples; and they gathered of all this certain tokens; some trunks so large that they were used in house-building. Leif came upon men who had been shipwrecked, and took them home with him, and gave them sustenance during the winter.

Eirik took coldly to the proposal to forsake his religion, but his wife, Thjodhild, promptly yielded, and caused a church to be built not very near the houses. The building was called Thjodhild's Church; in that spot she offered her prayers, and so did those men who received Christ, and they were many.

He was [for a long time against it, but did not say nay], when his friends exhorted him to go. They made ready the ship which Thorbjorn had brought there, and there were twenty men who undertook to start in her. They had little property, but chiefly weapons and food. On the morning when Eirik left home he took a little box, which had in it gold and silver; he hid the money, and then went forth on his journey.\\n\\nHe had proceeded, however, but a little way, when he fell from his horse, and broke his ribs and injured his shoulder, and cried out, \"Aiai!\" At this accident he sent word to his wife that she should take': array([ 0.01276288,  0.00192242,  0.00955385, ..., -0.02276945,\n",

Afterwards they sailed away out of Eiriksfjordr with gladness, as their plan seemed to promise success. They were driven about for a long time on the open sea, and came not into the track which they desired. They came in sight of Iceland, and also met with birds from the coast of Ireland. Then was their ship tossed to and fro on the sea. They returned about harvest-tide, worn out by toil and much exhausted, and reached Eiriksfjordr at the beginning of winter.\\n\\nThen spake Eirik, \"You were in better spirits in the summer, when you went forth out of the firth, than you are in now, and yet for all that there is much to be thankful for.\" Thorstein replied, \"It is a chieftain\\'s d': array([ 0.01868669, -0.00478879,  0.00785335, ..., -0.01674775,\n",

Thorstein owned a homestead in the Vestribygd on the estate known as Lysufjordr (shining firth).\\n\\n The man who was called Thorstein owned the other half of the homestead. His wife was called Sigrid. Thorstein went, during the autumn, to Lysufjordr, to his namesake, both he and Gudrid. Their reception was a welcome one. They were there during the winter. When little of the winter was past, the event happened there that fever broke out on their estate. The overseer of the work was named Garth. He was an unpopular man. He took the fever first and died. Afterwards, and with but little intermission, one took the fever after another and died. Then Thorstein, Eirik's son, fell ill, and also Sigrid, the wife of his namesake Thorstein.

He begged her also to pay over their property to the Church and some to the poor; and then he sank down for the second time.\\n\\nIt had been a custom in Greenland, after Christianity was brought there, to bury men in unconsecrated ground on the farms where they died.

Karlsefni was a man of good family, and very rich. His mother's name was Thorun. He engaged in trading journeys, and seemed a goodly, bold, and gallant traveller.\\n\\nOne summer Karlsefni prepared his ship, intending to go to Greenland. Snorri, Thorbrand's son, from Alptafjordr, resolved to travel with him, and there were thirty men in the company.\\n\\nThere was a man named Bjarni, Grimolf's son, a man of Breidafjordr (Broadfirth); another called Thorhall, son of Gamli, a man from\": array([ 0.02529813,  0.03111605,  0.01544036, ..., -0.01361   ,\n",

They had in the ship forty men.\\n\\nThe two ships launched out into the open sea as soon as they were ready. It is not recorded how long a voyage they had. But, after this, I have to tell you that both these ships came to Eiriksfjordr about autumn.\\n\\nEirik rode down to the ships with other men of the land, and a market-fair was promptly instituted. The captains invited Gudrid to take such of the merchandise as she wished, and Eirik displayed on his part much magnificence in return, inasmuch as he invited both these ships' companies home with him to pass the winter in Brattahlid.

The merchants accepted the invitation, and went home with Eirik. Afterwards their merchandise was removed to Brattahlid, where a good and large outhouse was not lacking in which to store the goods. The merchants were well pleased to stay with Eirik during the winter.\\n\\nWhen now Yule was drawing nigh, Eirik began to look more gloomy than he was wont to be.\\n\\nPresently Karlsefni entered into conversation with him, and said, \"Art thou in trouble, Eirik? it appears to me that thou art somewhat more taciturn than thou hast been; still thou helpest us with much liberality, and we are bound to reward thee according as we have means thereto. Say now what causes thy cheerlessness.\"\\n\\nEirik answered, \"You receive hospitality well, and like worthy men.

Then was preparation made for the Yule-feast, and so magnificent was it that the men thought they had scarcely ever seen so grand a feast.\\n\\nAnd after Yule, Karlsefni broached to Eirik the subject of a marriage with Gudrid, which he thought might be under Eirik\\'s control, and the woman appeared to him to be both beautiful and of excellent understanding.

Eirik answered and said, that for his part he would willingly undertake his suit, and said, moreover, that she was worthy of a good match. It is also likely, he thought, that she will be following out her destiny, should she be given to him; and, moreover, the report which comes to me of him is good.\\n\\nThe proposals were now laid before her, and she allowed the marriage with her to be arranged which Eirik wished to promote. However, I will not now speak at length how this marriage took place; the Yule festival was prolonged and made into a marriage-feast. Great joy was there in Brattahlid during the winter. Much playing at backgammon and telling of stories went on, and many things were done that ministered to the comfort of the household.\\n\\n\\nChapter 8\\n\\nDuring this time much talk took place in Brattahlid about making ready to go to Vinland the G\": array([-0.00218666,  0.03717822,  0.02390792, ..., -0.0135643 ,\n",

Bjarni and Thorhall ventured on the same expedition, with their ship and the retinue which had accompanied them.\\n\\nThere was a man named Thorvard; he married Freydis, natural daughter of Eirik the Red; he set out with them likewise, as also Thorvald, a son of Eirik.] There was a man named Thorvald; he was a son-in-law of Eirik the Red.

He had kept himself aloof from the true faith when it came to Greenland. He was but little encompassed with the love of friends, but yet Eirik had long held conversation with him. He went in the ship with Thorvald and his man, because he was widely acquainted with the unpeopled districts. They had the ship which Thorbjorn had brought to Greenland, and they ventured on the expedition with Karlsefni and the others; and most of them in this ship were Greenlanders.

There was a harbourless coast-land, and long sandy strands. They went to the land in boats, and found the keel of a ship, and called the place Kjalar-nes (Keelness). They gave also name to the strands, calling them Furdustrandir (wonder-shore), because it was tedious to sail by them.Then the coast became indented with creeks, and they directed their ships along the creeks.\\n\\nNow, before this, when Leif was with King Olaf Tryggvason,  and the king had requested him to preach Christianity in Greenland, he gave him two Scotch people, the man called Haki, and the woman called H√¶kja.

Now, when they had sailed by Furdustrandir, they put the Scotch people on land, and requested them to run into the southern regions, seek for choice land, and come back after three half-days were passed. They were dressed in such wise that they had on the garment which they called biafal. It was made with a hood at the top, open at the sides, without sleeves, and was fastened between the legs. A button and a loop held it together there; and elsewhere they were without clothing. Then did they cast anchors from the ships, and lay there to wait for them.

There was an island lying out in front of the firth, and there were great currents around the island, which they called Straums-ey (Stream-island). There were so many birds on it that scarcely was it possible to put one's feet down for the eggs. They continued their course up the firth, which they called Straumsfjordr, and carried their cargo ashore from the ships, and there they prepared to stay.

Thorhall the Sportsman wished to proceed northwards along Furdustrandir, and off Kjalarnes, and so seek Vinland; but Karlsefni desired to proceed southwards along the land and away from the east, because the land appeared to him the better the further south he went, and he thought it also more advisable to explore in both directions. Then did Thorhall make ready for his journey out by the islands, and there volunteered for the expedition with him not more than nine men; but with Karlsefni there went the remainder of the company. And one day, when Thorhall was carrying water to his ship, he drank, and recited this verse:\\n\\n\"The clashers of weapons did say when I came here that I should have the best of drink (though it becomes me not to complain before the common people).

Before they hoisted sail Thorhall recited a verse:\\n\\n\"Go we back where our countrymen are. Let us make the skilled hawk of the sand-heaven explore the broad ship-courses; while the dauntless rousers of the sword-storm, who praise the land, and cook whale, dwell on Furdustrandir.\"\\n\\nThen they left, and sailed northwards along Furdustrandir and Kjalarnes, and attempted there to sail against a wind from the west. A gale came upon them, however, and drove them onwards against Ireland, and there were they severely treated, enthralled, and beaten. Then Thorhall lost his life.\\n\\n\\nChapter 10\\n\\nKarlsefni proceeded southwards along the land, with Snorri and Bjarni and the rest of the company.

They journeyed a long while, and until they arrived at a river, which came down from the land and fell into a lake, and so on to the sea. There were large islands off the mouth of the river, and they could not come into the river except at high flood-tide.\\n\\nKarlsefni and his people sailed to the mouth of the river, and called the land Hop. There they found fields of wild wheat wherever there were low grounds; and the vine in all places were there was rough rising ground. Every rivulet there was full of fish. They made holes where the land and water joined and where the tide went highest; and when it ebbed they found halibut in the holes. There was great plenty of wild animals of every form in the wood. They were there half a month, amusing themselves, and not becoming aware of anything. Their cattle they had with them. And early one mornin': array([ 0.01764839,  0.0260709 ,  0.01510868, ...,  0.00378689,\n",

Their cattle they had with them. And early one morning, as they looked around, they beheld nine canoes made of hides, and snout-like staves were being brandished from the boats, and they made a noise like flails, and twisted round in the direction of the sun\\'s motion.\\n\\nThen Karlsefni said, \"What will this betoken?\" Snorri answered him, \"It may be that it is a token of peace; let us take a white shield and go to meet them.\" And so they did. Then did they in the canoes row forwards, and showed surprise at them, and came to land. They were short men, ill-looking, with their hair in disorderly fashion on their heads; they were large-eyed, and had broad cheeks. And they stayed there awhile in astonishment. Afterwards they rowed away to the south, off the headland.\\n\\n\\nChapter 11\\n\\nThey had built their settlements up above the lake.

And some of the dwellings were well within the land, but some were near the lake. Now they remained there that winter. They had no snow whatever, and all their cattle went out to graze without keepers.\\n\\n Now when spring began, they beheld one morning  early, that a fleet of hide-canoes was rowing from the south off the headland; so many were they as if the sea were strewn with pieces of charcoal, and there was also the brandishing of staves as before from each boat. Then they held shields up, and a market was formed between them; and this people in their purchases preferred red cloth; in exchange they had furs to give, and skins quite grey. They wished also to buy swords and lances, but Karlsefni and Snorri forbad it. They offered for the cloth dark hides, and took in exchange a span long of cloth, and bou': array([ 0.02552042,  0.01976625,  0.02279707, ..., -0.0075917 ,\n",

They offered for the cloth dark hides, and took in exchange a span long of cloth, and bound it round their heads; and so matters went on for a while. But when the stock of cloth began to grow small, then they split it asunder, so that it was not more than a finger's breadth. The Skr√¶lingar (Esquimaux) gave for it still quite as much, or more than before.\\n\\n\\nChapter 12\\n\\nNow it came to pass that a bull, which belonged to Karlsefni's people, rushed out of the wood and bellowed loudly at the same time. The Skr√¶lingar, frightened thereat, rushed away to their canoes, and rowed south along the coast. There was then nothing seen of them for three weeks together. When that time was gone by, there was seen approaching from the south a great crowd of Skr√¶lingar boats, coming down upon them like a stream, the staves this time being all brandished in the direction opposite to the sun's mot\": array([ 0.01227861,  0.04934652, -0.0017243 , ...,  0.00652732,\n",

Then took they and bare red shields to meet them. They encountered one another and fought, and there was a great shower of missiles. The Skr√¶lingar had also war-slings, or catapults.\\n\\nThen Karlsefni and Snorri see that the Skr√¶lingar are bringing up poles, with a very large ball attached to each, to be compared in size to a sheep's stomach, dark in colour; and these flew over Karlsefni's company towards the land, and when they came down they struck the ground with a hideous noise. This produced great terror in Karlsefni and his company, so that their only impulse was to retreat up the country along the river, because it seemed as if crowds of Skr√¶lingar were driving at them from all sides. And they stopped not until they came to certain crag\": array([ 0.02097308,  0.05211491,  0.01891769, ...,  0.0104054 ,\n",

She called out, \"Why run you away from such worthless creatures, stout men that ye are, when, as seems to me likely, you might slaughter them like so many cattle? Let me but have a weapon, I think I could fight better than any of you.\" They gave no heed to what she said. Freydis endeavoured to accompany them, still she soon lagged behind, because she was not well; she went after them into the wood, and the Skr√¶lingar directed their pursuit after her. She came upon a dead man; Thorbrand, Snorri\\'s son, with a flat stone fixed in his head; his sword lay beside him, so she took it up and prepared to defend herself therewith.\\n\\nThen came the Skr√¶lingar upon her.

She let down her sark and struck her breast with the naked sword. At this they were frightened, rushed off to their boats, and fled away. Karlsefni and the rest came up to her and praised her zeal. Two of Karlsefni's men fell, and four of the Skr√¶lingar, notwithstanding they had overpowered them by superior numbers. After that, they proceeded to their booths, and began to reflect about the crowd of men which attacked them upon the land; it appeared to them now that the one troop will have been that which came in the boats, and the other troop will have been a delusion of sight. The Skr√¶lingar also found a dead man, and his axe lay beside him. One of them struck a stone with it, and broke the axe. It seemed to them good for nothing, as it did not withstand the stone, and they threw it down.\\n\\n\\nChapter 13\\n\\n[Karlsefni and his comp\": array([ 0.03557659,  0.07036492, -0.00754098, ...,  0.02140113,\n",

They made ready, therefore, to move away, with intent to go to their own land. They sailed forth northwards, and found five Skr√¶lingar in jackets of skin, sleeping [near the sea], and they had with them a chest, and in it was marrow of animals mixed with blood; and they considered that these must have been outlawed. They slew them. Afterwards they came to a headland and a multitude of wild animals; and this headland appeared as if it might be a cake of cow-dung, because the animals passed the winter there. Now they came to Straumsfjordr, where also they had abundance of all kinds. It is said by some that Bjarni and Freydis re': array([ 0.01030964,  0.06082558, -0.00237062, ...,  0.01507405,\n",

But Karlsefni and Snorri journeyed southwards, and forty men with them, and after staying no longer than scarcely two months at Hop, had come back the same summer. Karlsefni set out with a single ship to seek Thorhall, but the (rest of the) company remained behind. He and his people went northwards off Kjalarnes, and were then borne onwards towards the west, and the land lay on their larboard-side, and was nothing but wilderness. And when they had proceeded for a long time, there was a river which came down from the land, flowing from the east towards the west. They directed their course within the river's mouth, and lay opposite the southern bank.\\n\\n\\nChapter 14\\n\\nOne morning Karlsefni's people beheld as it were a glitteri\": array([0.03051148, 0.02012929, 0.02802638, ..., 0.00173353, 0.0021503 ,\n",

It stirred itself, and it was a being of the race of men that have only one foot, and he came down quickly to where they lay. Thorvald, son of Eirik the Red, sat at the tiller, and the One-footer shot him with an arrow in the lower abdomen. He drew out the arrow. Then said Thorvald, \"Good land have we reached, and fat is it about the paunch.\" Then the One-footer leapt away again northwards. They chased after him, and saw him occasionally, but it seemed as if he would escape them. He disappeared at a certain creek. Then they turned back, and one man spake this ditty:\\n\\n\"Our men chased (all true it is) a One-footer down to the shore; but the wonderful man strove hard in the race....

They conjectured the mountains to be all one range; those, that is, which were at Hop, and those which they now discovered; almost answering to one another; and it was the same distance to them on both sides from Straumsfjordr. They journeyed back, and were in Straumsfjordr the third winter. Then fell the men greatly into backsliding. They who were wifeless pressed their claims at the hands of those who were married.\\n\\nSnorri, Karlsefni\\'s son, was born the first autumn, and he was three winters old when they began their journey home.

Karlsefni's people caught the children, but the others escaped and sunk down into the earth. And they took the children with them, and taught them their speech, and they were baptized. The children called their mother V√¶tilldi, and their father Uv√¶gi. They said that kings ruled over the land of the Skr√¶lingar, one of whom was called Avalldamon, and the other Valldidida. They said also that there were no houses, and the people lived in caves or holes. They said, moreover, that there was a land on the other side over against their land, and the people there were dressed in white garments, uttered loud cries, bare long poles, and wore fringes. This was supposed to be Hvitramannaland (whiteman's land). Then came they to Greenland, and remained with E\": array([ 0.03161628,  0.07960346,  0.03552995, ...,  0.00057634,\n",

They did not find it out before the ship was eaten through under them; then they debated what plan they should follow. They had a ship's boat which was smeared with tar made of seal-fat. It is said that the ship-worm will not bore into the wood which has been smeared with the seal-tar. The counsel and advice of most of the men was to ship into the boat as many men as it would hold. Now, when that was tried, the boat held not more than half the men.

Then Bjarni advised that it should be decided by the casting of lots, and not by the rank of the men, which of them should go into the boat; and inasmuch as every man there wished to go into the boat, though it could not hold all of them; therefore, they accepted the plan to cast lots who should leave the ship for the boat. And the lot so fell that Bjarni, and nearly half the men with him, were chosen for the boat. So then those left the ship and went into the boat who had been chosen by lot so to do.\\n\\nAnd when the men were come into the boat, a young man, an Icelander, who had been a fellow-traveller of Bjarni, said, \"Dost thou intend, Bjarni, to separate thyself here from me.\" \"It must needs be so now,\" Bjarni answered.

The man went into the boat, and Bjarni back into the ship; and it is said that Bjarni perished there in the Worm-sea, and they who were with him in the ship; but the boat and those who were in it went on their journey until they reached land, and told this story afterwards.\\n\\n\\nChapter 16\\n\\nThe next summer Karlsefni set out for Iceland, and Snorri with him, and went home to his house in Reynines.
