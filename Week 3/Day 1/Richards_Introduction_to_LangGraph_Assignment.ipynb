        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

The approach involves backpropagating gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank Adapters (LoRA). The best model family, named Guanaco, outperforms all previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the performance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a single GPU. Innovations include 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), double quantization, and paged optimizers to manage memory spikes.\\n\\n### Latest Information on Authors\\n1. **Tim Dettmers**\\n   - **Latest Tweet**: Unable to retrieve due to rate limit issues on DuckDuckGo.\\n\\n2. **Artidoro Pagnoni**\\n   - **Latest Tweet**: Unable to retrieve due to rate limit issues on DuckDuckGo.\\n\\n3. **Ari Holtzman**\\n   - **Latest Tweet**: Unable to retrieve due to rate limit issues on DuckDuckGo.\\n\\n4. **Luke Zettlemoyer**\\n   - **Latest Tweet**: Unable to retrieve due to rate limit issues on DuckDuckGo.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I encountered rate limit issues while trying to fetch the latest tweets for the authors.

ORCA stands for Objects, Relationships, Calls-to-Action, and Attributes. Here are the four key components:\\n\\n1. **Objects**: These are the primary nouns or entities within the system. Objects represent the core elements that users interact with. Identifying the key objects is the first step in understanding the structure of the user experience.\\n\\n2. **Relationships**: This component focuses on how the objects are connected to each other.

              "   'output': \"In the context of Object-Oriented UX (OOUX) and the ORCA (Objects, Relationships, Calls-to-Action, and Attributes) methodology, Calls-to-Action (CTAs) play a crucial role in defining the interactions and behaviors that users can perform with the objects in a system. Here's a breakdown of their role:\\n\\n1. **Defining User Interactions**: CTAs specify the actions that users can take on or with an object. This helps in understanding how users will interact with the system and what functionalities need to be provided.\\n\\n2. **Clarifying Object Behavior**: By identifying CTAs, designers can clarify the behavior of each object. This ensures that the objects are not just static entities but have dynamic interactions that align with user needs and business goals.\\n\\n3. **Enhancing User Experience**: Well-defined CTAs contribute to a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. They guide users on what actions are possible and how to achieve their goals within the system.\\n\\n4. **Supporting Consistency**: CTAs help maintain consistency across the system by standardizing the actions available for similar objects. This reduces cognitive load for users as they can predict the behavior of objects based on familiar CTAs.\\n\\n5. **Facilitating Design and Development**: Clear CTAs provide a blueprint for both designers and developers. Designers can create more effective interfaces, and developers can implement functionalities that align with the intended user interactions.\\n\\n6. **Prioritizing Features**: By identifying and prioritizing CTAs, teams can focus on the most critical actions that users need to perform, ensuring that the most important features are developed and refined first.\\n\\nIn summary, CTAs in the OOUX ORCA methodology are essential for defining how users interact with objects, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered design, and guiding the development process to create functional and intuitive systems.\",\n",

              "   'output': 'Object-Oriented UX (OOUX) and its ORCA (Objects, Relationships, Calls-to-Action, and Attributes) methodology offer a distinct approach to user experience design compared to traditional UX design methods. Here are some key differences:\\n\\n### 1. **Focus on Objects vs. Tasks:**\\n- **OOUX/ORCA:** Emphasizes identifying and defining the core objects (nouns) that users interact with, such as products, users, or orders. The methodology revolves around understanding these objects, their relationships, attributes, and the actions users can perform on them.\\n- **Traditional UX:** Often starts with user tasks and workflows, focusing on what users need to do (verbs) and designing interfaces to facilitate these tasks.\\n\\n### 2. **Information Architecture:**\\n- **OOUX/ORCA:** Builds the information architecture around the objects and their relationships. This leads to a more structured and consistent design, as the same objects are presented similarly across different parts of the application.\\n- **Traditional UX:** May build the information architecture around user tasks and scenarios, which can sometimes lead to inconsistencies if the same information is presented differently in different contexts.\\n\\n### 3. **Design Process:**\\n- **OOUX/ORCA:** Uses the ORCA process to systematically define Objects, Relationships, Calls-to-Action, and Attributes. This structured approach ensures that all aspects of the objects are considered and well-defined before moving on to interface design.\\n- **Traditional UX:** Often follows a more flexible and iterative process, starting with user research, creating personas, defining user journeys, wireframing, prototyping, and testing. The focus is on refining the design through user feedback and iteration.\\n\\n### 4. **Consistency and Reusability:**\\n- **OOUX/ORCA:** Promotes consistency and reusability by defining objects and their attributes clearly. This makes it easier to maintain a consistent design language and reuse components across different parts of the application.\\n- **Traditional UX:** While it also aims for consistency, it may not have the same level of structured reusability as OOUX. Consistency is often achieved through design systems and style guides.\\n\\n### 5. **User Understanding:**\\n- **OOUX/ORCA:** Aims to create a mental model that aligns closely with how users naturally think about the objects in the system. This can make the interface more intuitive and easier to learn.\\n- **Traditional UX:** Focuses on understanding user needs, pain points, and behaviors to create designs that are user-friendly and effective. The mental model is built around user tasks and goals.\\n\\n### 6. **Complex Systems:**\\n- **OOUX/ORCA:** Particularly effective for complex systems with many interrelated objects, as it helps to manage complexity by breaking it down into manageable components.\\n- **Traditional UX:** Can also handle complex systems but may rely more on user flows and task analysis to manage complexity.\\n\\nIn summary, OOUX and the ORCA methodology provide a structured, object-centric approach to UX design, focusing on defining and understanding the core objects and their relationships. Traditional UX design, on the other hand, is more task-centric and flexible, focusing on user tasks, workflows, and iterative refinement. Both approaches have their strengths and can be chosen based on the specific needs of the project.',\n",

Here's a breakdown of noun-foraging and its importance:\\n\\n### What is Noun-Foraging?\\n\\nNoun-foraging is the process of identifying and gathering all the key nouns (objects) that are relevant to the system or application being designed. These nouns represent the core entities that users will interact with. The process involves:\\n\\n1. **Research and Discovery**: Analyzing user needs, business requirements, and existing systems to identify potential objects.\\n2. **Brainstorming and Listing**: Creating a comprehensive list of nouns that represent the entities within the system.\\n3. **Validation and Refinement**: Collaborating with stakeholders and users to validate and refine the list of nouns to ensure they accurately represent the system's core objects.\\n\\n### Why is Noun-Foraging Important?\\n\\n1. **Clarity and Focus**: By identifying the core objects, designers can focus on what truly matters to users, ensuring that the design is centered around the most important elements.\\n2. **Consistency**: Establishing a clear set of objects helps maintain consistency across the system, making it easier for users to understand and navigate.\\n3. **Scalability**: A well-defined set of objects provides a solid foundation for future enhancements and scalability, as new features can be added without disrupting the core structure.\\n4. **Improved Communication**: Having a shared understanding of the core objects facilitates better communication among team members, stakeholders, and users.\\n5. **User-Centric Design**: By focusing on the objects that users interact with, designers can create more intuitive and user-friendly interfaces that align with users' mental models.\\n\\nIn summary, noun-foraging is a foundational step in the OOUX methodology that helps ensure the design is user-centered, consistent, and scalable.

Understand the steps and components of attention mechanism architecture and see examples of its applications. 1. Introduction. Self-attention, also known as scaled dot-product attention, is a fundamental concept in the field of NLP and deep learning. It plays a pivotal role in tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis. They all use transformer architecture with attention mechanisms at their core to solve problems across domains. In the Transformer series, we go over the ingredients that have made Transformers a universal recipe for machine learning. First up, we take a visual dive to understand the attention mechanism: Why transformers and attention took over. Attention mechanism is a fundamental invention in artificial intelligence and machine learning, redefining the capabilities of deep learning models. This mechanism, inspired by the human mental process of selective focus, has emerged as a pillar in a variety of applications, accelerating developments in natural language processing, computer vision, and beyond. In the ever-evolving field of deep learning, one concept that has garnered significant attention (pun intended) is the Attention Mechanism.
