        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

The team behind QLoRA includes Allen School Ph.D. student Artidoro Pagnoni; alum Ari Holtzman (Ph.D., \\'23), incoming professor at the University of Chicago; and professor Luke Zettlemoyer, who is also a research manager at Meta.

Evaluating the factuality of long-form text generated by large language models (LMs) is nontrivial because (1) generations often contain a mixture of... Large language models are trained in two stages: (1) unsupervised pretraining from raw text, to learn general-purpose representations, and (2) large scale instruction tuning and reinforcement learning, to better align to end tasks and user preferences. We measure the relative importance of these two stages by training LIMA, a 65B parameter LLaMa language model fine-tuned with the standard ...\", name='duckduckgo_search', tool_call_id='call_b6EziRLLCDF84oVh6T4mqiO4')]\n",

Identifying the key objects is the first step in the ORCA process.\\n\\n2. **Relationships**: This component focuses on how the objects are connected or related to each other. Understanding these relationships helps in structuring the system in a way that makes sense to the user.\\n\\n3. **Calls-to-Action (CTAs)**: These are the actions that users can take on the objects. Identifying the CTAs helps in defining the functionality and interactions within the system.\\n\\n4. **Attributes**: These are the properties or characteristics of the objects. Attributes provide more detail about the objects and help in defining their structure and behavior.\\n\\nBy focusing on these four components, the ORCA methodology helps in creating a user experience that is intuitive, consistent, and aligned with the user's mental model.\",\n",

Here\\'s how CTAs fit into the ORCA methodology:\\n\\n1. **Objects**: In OOUX, the focus is on identifying the core objects that users interact with. CTAs are often directly related to these objects. For example, if an object is a \"Product,\" a CTA might be \"Add to Cart\" or \"Buy Now.\" These actions are essential for users to interact meaningfully with the objects.\\n\\n2. **Relationships**: CTAs help define and clarify the relationships between different objects. For instance, a CTA like \"View Related Products\" can help users understand the relationship between a product and other similar items.\\n\\n3. **Calls-to-Action**: This is where CTAs are explicitly defined. In the ORCA methodology, CTAs are identified and designed to ensure that users can perform the necessary actions on the objects. This step involves determining what actions users need to take and how those actions will be presented to them.\\n\\n4. **Attributes**: Attributes are the properties or characteristics of the objects. CTAs often interact with these attributes. For example, a CTA like \"Filter by Price\" interacts with the price attribute of a product object.\\n\\nIn summary, CTAs in the OOUX ORCA methodology are essential for enabling users to interact with the core objects of the system. They guide users through the necessary actions, help clarify relationships between objects, and ensure that the user experience is intuitive and effective.',\n",

              "   'output': \"Object-Oriented User Experience (OOUX) and the ORCA methodology offer a unique approach to UX design that differs from traditional UX design approaches in several key ways:\\n\\n### 1. **Object-Centric vs. Task-Centric:**\\n   - **OOUX/ORCA:** Focuses on identifying and defining the core objects (nouns) within a system and their relationships. The design process revolves around these objects and how users interact with them.\\n   - **Traditional UX:** Often task-centric, focusing on user tasks and workflows (verbs). The design process typically starts with user tasks and scenarios.\\n\\n### 2. **Structured Information Architecture:**\\n   - **OOUX/ORCA:** Emphasizes a structured and systematic approach to information architecture by defining objects, relationships, calls-to-action, and attributes (ORCA). This helps in creating a clear and consistent structure.\\n   - **Traditional UX:** Information architecture may be more flexible and less structured, often evolving organically based on user research and testing.\\n\\n### 3. **Consistency and Reusability:**\\n   - **OOUX/ORCA:** Promotes consistency and reusability by defining objects and their attributes clearly. This can lead to more consistent user interfaces and interactions.\\n   - **Traditional UX:** While consistency is important, it may not be as systematically enforced. Reusability is often considered but not always a primary focus.\\n\\n### 4. **Design Process:**\\n   - **OOUX/ORCA:** The ORCA process involves four main steps: Objects, Relationships, Calls-to-Action, and Attributes. This structured approach ensures that all aspects of the system are considered.\\n   - **Traditional UX:** The design process can vary widely but often includes steps like user research, wireframing, prototyping, and user testing. The focus is more on iterative design and user feedback.\\n\\n### 5. **User Understanding:**\\n   - **OOUX/ORCA:** Aims to align the system's structure with the user's mental model by focusing on objects that users naturally think about.\\n   - **Traditional UX:** Also aims to align with the user's mental model but may do so through different means, such as user personas, scenarios, and journey mapping.\\n\\n### 6. **Problem-Solving Approach:**\\n   - **OOUX/ORCA:** Takes a more systematic and analytical approach to problem-solving by breaking down the system into its core components (objects) and understanding their interactions.\\n   - **Traditional UX:** May take a more holistic and iterative approach, focusing on solving user problems through continuous testing and refinement.\\n\\n### 7. **Documentation and Communication:**\\n   - **OOUX/ORCA:** Provides clear documentation of objects, their attributes, and relationships, which can improve communication among team members and stakeholders.\\n   - **Traditional UX:** Documentation can vary but may include user flows, wireframes, and prototypes. Communication is often more focused on user tasks and scenarios.\\n\\n### Summary:\\nOOUX and the ORCA methodology offer a structured, object-centric approach to UX design, focusing on defining and understanding the core objects within a system and their relationships. This contrasts with traditional UX design, which is often more task-centric and iterative, focusing on user tasks and workflows. Both approaches have their strengths and can be complementary depending on the project and context.\",\n",

OOUX is a design approach that focuses on identifying and organizing the core objects within a system to create a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. Here's a breakdown of what noun-foraging is and why it is important:\\n\\n### What is Noun-Foraging?\\n\\nNoun-foraging is the process of identifying the key nouns (objects) that are central to the system or application you are designing. These nouns represent the primary entities that users will interact with. The process involves:\\n\\n1. **Research and Discovery**: Gathering information from various sources such as user interviews, existing documentation, and competitive analysis to identify potential objects.\\n2. **Listing and Categorizing**: Creating a comprehensive list of nouns and categorizing them based on their relevance and relationships.\\n3. **Validation**: Ensuring that the identified nouns are indeed the core objects that users will interact with and that they align with user needs and business goals.\\n\\n### Why is Noun-Foraging Important?\\n\\n1. **Clarity and Focus**: By identifying the core objects, designers can focus on what truly matters to users, leading to a more streamlined and effective design.\\n2. **Consistency**: It helps in maintaining consistency across the system by ensuring that the same objects are represented in the same way throughout the user interface.\\n3. **User-Centric Design**: Noun-foraging ensures that the design is centered around the user's mental model, making it easier for users to understand and navigate the system.\\n4. **Scalability**: A clear understanding of the core objects allows for easier scaling and adding new features without disrupting the existing system.\\n5. **Improved Communication**: It provides a common language for designers, developers, and stakeholders, facilitating better communication and collaboration.\\n\\nIn summary, noun-foraging is a foundational activity in OOUX that helps in creating a user-centered, consistent, and scalable design by focusing on the core objects that users interact with.\",\n",
