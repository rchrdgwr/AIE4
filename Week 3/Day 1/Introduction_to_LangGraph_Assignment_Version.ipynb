        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

The ORCA methodology, which stands for Objects, Relationships, Calls-to-Action, and Attributes, is a framework designed to create a more intuitive and user-centered design by focusing on the core objects that users interact with.\\n\\nHere\\'s how CTAs fit into the ORCA methodology:\\n\\n1. **Objects**: These are the primary entities that users interact with. For example, in an e-commerce site, objects might include products, categories, and user profiles.\\n\\n2. **Relationships**: These define how objects are connected to each other. For example, a product might belong to a category, or a user might have a wishlist of products.\\n\\n3. **Calls-to-Action (CTAs)**: CTAs are the actions that users can take on or with objects. They are the interactive elements that drive user engagement and help users achieve their goals. Examples of CTAs include \"Add to Cart,\" \"Sign Up,\" \"Download,\" and \"Share.\"\\n\\n4. **Attributes**: These are the details or properties of objects. For example, a product might have attributes like price, description, and reviews.\\n\\n### Role of CTAs in OOUX ORCA Methodology\\n\\n1. **User Guidance**: CTAs provide clear instructions to users on what actions they can take next. This helps in reducing cognitive load and making the user journey more intuitive.\\n\\n2. **Goal Achievement**: CTAs are designed to help users achieve their goals efficiently. Whether it\\'s purchasing a product, signing up for a newsletter, or downloading a resource, CTAs facilitate these actions.\\n\\n3. **Interaction Design**: By clearly defining CTAs for each object, designers can create a more structured and predictable interaction model. This consistency helps users understand how to interact with different objects within the system.\\n\\n4. **Prioritization**: CTAs help in prioritizing actions based on user needs and business goals. For example, a primary CTA like \"Buy Now\" might be more prominently displayed than a secondary CTA like \"Add to Wishlist.\"\\n\\n5. **Feedback and Engagement**: Effective CTAs provide immediate feedback to users, confirming that their actions have been successful. This can enhance user satisfaction and encourage further engagement.\\n\\n6. **Contextual Relevance**: In the ORCA methodology, CTAs are contextually relevant to the objects they are associated with. This ensures that users are presented with appropriate actions based on the current context and their interactions with the object.\\n\\nIn summary, CTAs are a vital component of the OOUX ORCA methodology as they drive user interaction, facilitate goal achievement, and enhance the overall user experience by providing clear, actionable steps within the context of the objects and their relationships.',\n",

This results in a more intuitive and solid foundation for the design.\\n\\n3. **Early Clarity**: Traditional design methods may leave unanswered questions until late in the development process. OOUX aims to clarify these questions early by focusing on the underlying structure of the system.\\n\\n4. **ORCA Process**: The ORCA process in OOUX stands for Objects, Relationships, Calls-to-action, and Attributes.

OOUX is a design approach that focuses on identifying and organizing the core objects (nouns) and their relationships within a system to create a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. Here's a breakdown of noun-foraging and its importance:\\n\\n### What is Noun-Foraging?\\n\\nNoun-foraging is the process of identifying and gathering the key nouns (objects) that are central to the system or application being designed. These nouns represent the primary entities that users will interact with. The process involves:\\n\\n1. **Research and Discovery**: Analyzing user needs, business goals, and existing systems to identify potential objects.\\n2. **Stakeholder Interviews**: Engaging with stakeholders to understand their perspectives and gather insights on important objects.\\n3. **Content Analysis**: Reviewing existing content, documentation, and data models to extract relevant nouns.\\n4. **User Research**: Conducting user interviews, surveys, and usability tests to uncover the objects that users naturally think about and interact with.\\n\\n### Why is Noun-Foraging Important?\\n\\n1. **Clarity and Consistency**: By identifying the core objects, designers can create a consistent and clear structure for the user interface. This helps users understand the system more easily and navigate it more intuitively.\\n\\n2. **User-Centered Design**: Noun-foraging ensures that the design is centered around the user's mental model. By focusing on the objects that users care about, designers can create interfaces that align with how users think and work.\\n\\n3. **Improved Communication**: Having a clear set of objects helps in communicating the design to stakeholders, developers, and other team members. It provides a common language and reference point for discussions and decision-making.\\n\\n4. **Scalability and Flexibility**: A well-defined object model makes it easier to scale and adapt the system in the future. New features and functionalities can be added by extending the existing objects or introducing new ones without disrupting the overall structure.\\n\\n5. **Efficiency in Design and Development**: By focusing on the core objects, designers and developers can streamline their efforts, avoid unnecessary complexity, and ensure that the most important aspects of the system are prioritized.\\n\\nIn summary, noun-foraging is a foundational activity in OOUX that helps create a user-centered, intuitive, and scalable design by identifying and organizing the key objects within a system.\",\n",

This ensures a clear understanding of what each object represents and its importance.\\n\\n3. **Relationship Diagrams**: Diagrams that illustrate how objects are related to each other. These relationships can include hierarchies, associations, and dependencies.\\n\\n4. **Calls-to-Action (CTAs)**: Identification and definition of the key actions that users can perform on or with each object. This includes understanding the primary interactions that drive user engagement.\\n\\n5. **Attributes List**: A comprehensive list of attributes for each object, detailing the properties and data points that define the object. This helps in ensuring that all necessary information is captured and available for the user.\\n\\n6. **User Stories and Scenarios**: Narratives that describe how users will interact with the objects and the system as a whole. These stories help in validating the design and ensuring it meets user needs.\\n\\n7. **Wireframes and Prototypes**: Visual representations of the user interface, showing how objects, relationships, CTAs, and attributes come together in the final design. These prototypes are used for testing and refining the user experience.\\n\\n8. **Content Model**: A structured model that outlines how content is organized, managed, and displayed within the system. This model ensures consistency and coherence in content presentation.\\n\\nBy focusing on these outputs, the OOUX ORCA methodology helps in creating a user experience that is intuitive, consistent, and aligned with the user's mental model of the system.\",\n",

The mechanism works by assigning different weights to different parts of the input, enabling the model to prioritize more important information.\\n\\nThere are several types of attention mechanisms, including:\\n\\n1. **Self-Attention**: Also known as intra-attention, this mechanism allows a model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence, regardless of their position. It is a key component of the Transformer model, which has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP).\\n\\n2. **Global Attention**: This mechanism considers all parts of the input sequence when generating each part of the output sequence.\\n\\n3. **Local Attention**: This mechanism focuses on a specific part of the input sequence, which is particularly useful for tasks requiring fine-grained focus.\\n\\nThe Transformer model, introduced in the paper \"Attention is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al., has been a groundbreaking development in NLP, largely due to its effective use of the attention mechanism.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 458, 'prompt_tokens': 1200, 'total_tokens': 1658}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_157b3831f5', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-0f5b8544-2789-40fd-9cd0-f6089598c9bb-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1200, 'output_tokens': 458, 'total_tokens': 1658})]\n",
