        "### Why Cycles?\n",

        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

For instance, a product might belong to a category, or a user might have a wishlist of products.\\n\\n3. **Calls-to-Action (CTAs)**: CTAs are the interactive elements that prompt users to take specific actions. They are the verbs in the user interface that drive the interaction forward. Examples of CTAs include buttons like \"Add to Cart,\" \"Sign Up,\" \"Download,\" or \"Share.\" In the ORCA methodology, CTAs are carefully designed to ensure they are clear, compelling, and aligned with the user\\'s goals and the overall user journey.\\n\\n4. **Attributes**: These are the details or properties of the objects.

The design process revolves around user flows and interactions.\\n   - **OOUX**: Shifts the focus to the objects (nouns) within the system. It emphasizes understanding and defining the core objects and their relationships before considering user tasks.\\n\\n2. **System Structure vs. Interface Layout**:\\n   - **Traditional UX Design**: May begin with designing the interface or page layout, focusing on how users will interact with the system.\\n   - **OOUX**: Prioritizes the underlying structure of the system. It aims to create a solid foundation by clearly defining the objects and their attributes, which leads to a more intuitive and cohesive design.\\n\\n3. **Early Clarity vs. Late Unanswered Questions**:\\n   - **Traditional UX Design**: Can leave some questions unanswered until later stages of the development process, potentially leading to rework.\\n   - **OOUX**: By focusing on objects and their relationships early on, it provides clarity and reduces ambiguity, leading to a more streamlined development process.\\n\\n4. **Borrowing from Object-Oriented Programming**:\\n   - **Traditional UX Design**: Does not typically borrow concepts from programming paradigms.\\n   - **OOUX**: Borrows principles from object-oriented programming, such as encapsulation and inheritance, to create a more structured and systematic approach to design.\\n\\n5. **User Development Communication**:\\n   - **Traditional UX Design**: Communication may be more focused on user flows and interface elements.\\n   - **OOUX**: Provides a structured approach to user development communication by focusing on the main building blocks (objects) in a digital environment.\\n\\nIn summary, OOUX ORCA methodology provides a more structured and systematic approach by focusing on the core objects within a system, leading to a more intuitive and cohesive design compared to the task-oriented focus of traditional UX design approaches.',\n",

OOUX is a design approach that focuses on identifying and organizing the core objects within a system or application to create a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. Here's a breakdown of noun-foraging and its importance:\\n\\n### What is Noun-Foraging?\\n\\nNoun-foraging is the process of identifying and collecting the key nouns (objects) that are central to the system or application being designed. These nouns represent the primary entities that users will interact with. The process involves:\\n\\n1. **Research and Discovery**: Gathering information from various sources such as user interviews, existing documentation, competitive analysis, and domain knowledge to identify potential objects.\\n2. **Listing and Categorizing**: Creating a comprehensive list of nouns and categorizing them based on their relevance and relationships.\\n3. **Validation**: Ensuring that the identified nouns are indeed the core objects that users will interact with and that they align with user needs and business goals.\\n\\n### Why is Noun-Foraging Important?\\n\\n1. **Clarity and Focus**: By identifying the core objects, designers can focus on what truly matters to users, ensuring that the design is centered around the most important elements.\\n2. **Consistency**: It helps in maintaining consistency across the system by ensuring that the same objects are represented in the same way throughout the user interface.\\n3. **User-Centric Design**: Noun-foraging ensures that the design is aligned with how users think and interact with the system, leading to a more intuitive and user-friendly experience.\\n4. **Efficiency**: It streamlines the design process by providing a clear structure and reducing the need for constant revisions and redesigns.\\n5. **Scalability**: A well-defined set of core objects makes it easier to scale the system or application in the future, as new features can be added without disrupting the existing structure.\\n\\nIn summary, noun-foraging is a foundational step in OOUX that helps designers create a more organized, intuitive, and user-centered experience by focusing on the core objects that users interact with.\",\n",

This map helps in understanding the core entities that the user will interact with.\\n\\n2. **Object Definitions**: Detailed descriptions of each object, including their attributes and the roles they play within the system. This ensures a clear understanding of what each object represents and its importance.\\n\\n3. **Relationship Diagrams**: Diagrams that illustrate how objects are related to each other. These relationships can include hierarchies, associations, and dependencies.\\n\\n4. **Calls-to-Action (CTAs)**: Identification and definition of the key actions that users can perform on or with each object. This includes understanding the primary interactions that drive user engagement.\\n\\n5. **Attributes List**: A comprehensive list of attributes for each object, detailing the properties and data points that define the object. This helps in ensuring that all necessary information is captured and available for the user.\\n\\n6. **User Stories and Scenarios**: Narratives that describe how users will interact with the objects and the system as a whole. These stories help in validating the design and ensuring it meets user needs.\\n\\n7. **Wireframes and Prototypes**: Visual representations of the user interface that incorporate the objects, relationships, CTAs, and attributes. These prototypes help in testing and refining the design before development.\\n\\n8. **Content Model**: A structured model that outlines how content is organized and managed within the system, based on the identified objects and their attributes.\\n\\nBy focusing on these outputs, the OOUX ORCA methodology ensures a user-centered design that is both intuitive and aligned with the user's mental model.\",\n",

Self-attention, also known as scaled dot-product attention, is a fundamental concept in the field of NLP and deep learning. It plays a pivotal role in tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and sentiment analysis. Attention mechanism is a fundamental invention in artificial intelligence and machine learning, redefining the capabilities of deep learning models. This mechanism, inspired by the human mental process of selective focus, has emerged as a pillar in a variety of applications, accelerating developments in natural language processing, computer vision, and beyond. They all use transformer architecture with attention mechanisms at their core to solve problems across domains. In the Transformer series, we go over the ingredients that have made Transformers a universal recipe for machine learning.
