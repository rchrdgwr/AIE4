How did the first John Wick film break the mold in terms of the typical action hero portrayal?,"[': 5\nReview: The first John Wick film was special because it broke a mold of sorts. It went against certain action film conventions - the hero was not a muscle bound hulk like a Schwarzenegger or Stallone, the action was super fast paced, the plot was basic and straighforward, but introduced some unique elements, and there was something a bit unique and stylish about the film. John Wick was cool.'
 "": 9\nReview: At first glance, John Wick sounds like a terrible film on paper but with the slickness of Keanu Reeves' performance as the titular character and the sheer brilliance in its action sequences, this marks the best action film of the year and one of the absolute best in the past decade. Following a brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved dog murdered by thugs from his past, John Wick vows revenge on the ones who have taken what he loves most. Like I said, on paper, this seems like a direct-to-DVD slopfest starring John Cena but as a film with Keanu Reeves as the lead, it marks the very welcomed return for Reeves to the genre. John Wick is insanely fun, violently brutal and an overall romp especially for those disappointed by The Expendables 3. John Wick is propelled by Tarantino-esque dialog mixed with the swagger of action stars from the 70s. Reeves literally emulates cool in this film and does it with such confidence, that we don't even doubt the character...even when he kills countless bad guys with extreme force in some utterly ridiculous and implausible situations. We don't doubt it for a minute. This is EXACTLY what you want out of an action film. It is briskly paced, brilliantly shot and meticulously choreographed and keeps you wanting more and more. The supporting cast filled with the likes of John Legiuzamo, Ian McShane, and Willen Dafoe also keeps this film very interesting. These guys don't play good guys, hell, John Wick by traditional standards would be a bad guy in any other film. Every character is more ruthless than the next and pushes John Wick to be more ruthless than they are, creating a very cool dynamic between the character and the plot regarding the idea of how far is too far? However, don't expect some revelation from John Wick regarding the morality of bad and evil. This film wants you entertained and does so with brute force, it never lets up, not even for a second. One scene in particular that will have your blood pumping is a showdown between thugs and Wick in a nightclub. This action sequence remains the best in the film and will have you grasping your theater seat because of the sheer intensity of it. Overall, John Wick is slick, violent fun that turns into a remarkable, surprising film that will catch you off guard. It is THAT good. I highly recommend this film to action buffs especially but I'm sure those who just like a good movie will love it as well.""
 "": 20\nReview: John Wick is something special. It takes as much time setting up elaborate action sequences as it does the world with which it all takes place in. And what a world it is. It reminds me of Millers Crossing and it is cooler than any other recent attempt at noir. We are shown a criminal underworld where, if you are connected, many powerful people know who you are and show you respect. John Wick was connected but he got out. He is the rare killer who has found peace, and he is grateful for that peace. Some young kids steal that from him and he does what he does best, he wages a one man war against the Russian Mafia. It might sound like the film takes quite a leap but it all makes sense. The motives of John and the people who get in the way of his bullets are all very clear, even if it does come across as rather simple. That's the plot at it's most basic. Then there's the action. The film is directed by Reeve's stuntman from The Matrix, so this guy knows action. There are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films and their quick cuts to shame. Keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the film and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is that we have not seen him like this before. Along the way are plenty of character actors, fans of The Matrix and The Wire will recognize a few people then there are more obvious ones like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe. Everyone seems to be having a good time. That is another plus for this movie. It get's dark at times but overall it is quite fun, not very chipper, but fun. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I believe it is a must see for action fans and for anyone looking for something a bit different from the usual fare.""
 "": 0\nReview: The best way I can describe John Wick is to picture Taken but instead of Liam Neeson it's Keanu Reeves and instead of his daughter it's his dog. That's essentially the plot of the movie. John Wick (Reeves) is out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him. It's a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action movies get convoluted, they get bad i.e. A Good Day to Die Hard. John Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. John Wick succeeds in its simplicity.""

Unlike today\'s action movies, it doesn\'t use quick-cuts or shaky cameras actually see what\'s going on.'

 ': 9\nReview: ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is an American movie from this year (2017). Experienced visual effects artist Stahelski and Kolstad returned from the very first Wick film to work on the script/direction here too, so the premise with regard to people working behind the camera is there. And in front of the camera we see familiar faces again, people that survived the film, like most of all Keanu Reeves playing the central character. This is a really long film at over 2 hours and at this runtime, it is considerably longer than the first. And there is a lot other stuff different compared to the original. Most has to do with the fun component. I think the first film was a great fun watch from start to finish while offering emotion nonetheless and also delivering in the crime and drama genres. And action too, but I don\'t care too much about that. This genre is also basically the only one where this new movie delivers as the first 30 minutes are truly packed with action. It gets less afterward, but there is no denying that it was still all about the action and nothing else.'
 ': 17\nReview: There are actually quite a handful reasons why ""John Wick"" could have become a failure. The two directors have never made a film before and almost exclusively worked in the stunt department so far. The writer is not exactly experienced either. Lead actor Keanu Reeves usually scores more through boyish charm than through realistic portrayal of gritty badass characters. And the genre of crime action thrillers rarely delivers in terms of real significance. Still it became a very good film. The main reason for that is probably that it does not attempt to be anything of great cinematic value, does not try to teach groundbreaking stories on moral, loyalty or betrayal. Instead, Derek Kolstad\'s script goes for a gutsy revenge thriller that is not even hurt by its occasional predictability.'
 "": 18\nReview: Ever since the original John Wick, the franchise has set a standard of what action in Hollywood should be. Thanks to Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeve's knowledge of the technical aspects of shooting action, they've been able to deliver expertly choreographed, shot, and edited action films that are now the go to as examples of great action filmmaking. And so, the expectations for the fourth film were fairly high, especially as it became more apparent this was not only the culmination of everything before it, but a whopping 169 minutes long. Rest assured, however, that it delivers in spades. Everything we have come to know and love is here, but with an infusion of creativity like we haven't seen from the franchise yet.""
 "": 11\nReview: JOHN WICK is a rare example of Hollywood getting things spot-on when it comes to creating the near-perfect action film. JOHN WICK is a relentless, pulse-pounding thriller that has plenty of similarity to the Liam Neeson classic TAKEN, albeit with a more simplistic (and also more emotionally intense) plot line. This is the kind of lean, pared-down film-making that's all about intensity and momentum. It sits well with classic international fare like POINT BLANK, SLEEPLESS NIGHT, MEA CULPA, THE MAN FROM NOWHERE, and THE RAID films.""
 "": 10\nReview: The first John Wick film took me by surprise; it was a cartoonish action film that was surprisingly brutal in its content, cruel in its delivery, and had a real punch to it. All of it existed inside a world that convinced in its own logic, even if it was clearly fantasy. John Wick 2 doesn't have the ability to sneak up on me unannounced, which does work against it, but this is not what hurts it the most.""
 "": 6\nReview: In 2014, a Keanu Reeves revenge thriller John Wick became a surprise hit. I originally skipped out on the film as I felt that the trailers only showed an assassin story that I felt I've seen before. As far as I'm concerned, I made a big mistake. Before seeing the sequel, I felt it was important to watch the first one. I rented it on Amazon Prime and I was shock by what I saw; a dark, stylish, and fun action movie that is doing it's own thing. Though I've seen plenty stories about revenge (The Count of Monte Cristo and Moby Dick being the prime examples), I can't recall one over someone's pet being murdered.""
 "": 7\nReview: John Wick (2014) is the best revenge flick from Keanu Reeves of 2014 from The Matrix (1999) to John Wick (2014) another action fast paced, Entertaining slick action packed film, which kind I have never seen before. It is a very fun, straightforward action movie with an 80's sensibility. It's nice to see Keanu doing these types of roles again. It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves movies. Keanu Reeves is a bad ass what a great action packed blood packed film. Movies should really learn from this on how to make a decent action film, especially with the crap we are getting today like escape plan bullet to the head and such. This film to me is the greatest action film to come out in this century. Keanu was phenomenal the action was so fast paced and exciting my jaw literally dropped as Keanu took out all the bad guys! I personally think this film is better then all Taken films combined. It was simply brilliant, it was made for 20 million dollars and I am glad it made 40 million in the US. I think this film deserved to make 100 million!""]","The first John Wick film broke the mold in terms of the typical action hero portrayal by featuring a hero who was not a muscle-bound hulk like Schwarzenegger or Stallone.

How do the action sequences in John Wick Chapter 3 improve the viewer experience compared to previous movies?,"[': 19\nReview: The inevitable third chapter of the JOHN WICK franchise continues on a high with the same quality as the last. In fact, this may just pip that one to the post to be the best JOHN WICK yet. The pacing is spot on and the plotting is measured by a huge amount of action sequences, all of which fizz and crackle with skill and energy. The movie hits the ground running as Keanu faces off with a hulking character in a library and then Triads in a weapon shop, but what really amazes here is the sheer inventiveness of the non-repetitive action. There are horse and motorbike chases, a Moroccan brawl with fighting dogs, alongside the massive action of the climax. There also seems to be a greater emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, featuring the likes of RAID actors and old-timer Mark Dacascos, which is a real pleasure as the choreography is top-notch. In terms of sheer enjoyment, this is a film hard to beat, and to criticise it at all is unnecessary. Bring on the fourth!'
 "": 13\nReview: Following on from two deliriously entertaining, visually gorgeous and blissfully simplistic thrillers, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum keeps up the franchise's unique appeal in stunning fashion. Complete with electrifying action, beautiful cinematography, a pulsating score and a great sense of humour, the film is pretty much as purely joyful as action thrillers get, and proves two hours of brilliant entertainment.""
 "": 14\nReview: By now you know what to expect from a John Wick movie. I thought the franchise was losing a little momentum in chapter 3 so I was worried this could be disappointing. It's not. It's even more on steroids than any Wick before! Even close to 3 hours it doesn't feel to long which is very special for a action movie. This franchise has set new standards. If anybody says a movie is good like John Wick, it better f'n be! The set pieces as everyone mentioned before are really insane this time. The Tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. The only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub, eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club, but then again it's a shady nightclub for high table people. If you liked the first three movies, get your ass to the cinema. Yeah.""

 ': 2\nReview: The first three John Wick films came in fairly quick succession, with only five years between the first and third chapters, each film trying to top the one before in terms of wild set pieces. For me, it all became a bit too much, the action rapidly becoming too frenetic and over-the-top. By Parabellum (part three), I had had enough.'
 ': 0\nReview: It is 5 years since the first John Wick film - one that took me by surprise by how silly it was as a narrative, but yet how well it delivered action sequences. The second film was only 2 years ago, and it raised the stakes and went from a man seeking revenge on another group of people, into one where the world was filled with assassins, popping up from everywhere all the time. I remember ending that film feeling like it had gone too far but that the third would probably do more of that. True enough, Parabellum (""prepare for war"") sees the whole world filled with assassins, and a huge administrative system around them - but yet the whole lot of them can\'t seem to cause John Wick too much trouble. As with the first film, this expands the world more than it can bear, and although it looks cool at times, the world makes no sense whatsoever and it hurts the film the more it relies on it (which it does as it expands it).'

Slow and ambiguous at first, but reveals more as it goes along, and once it kicks into gear it rarely lets up with plenty of stylized, visceral action scenes, an impressive arsenal of weaponry, plus sly direction and editing that give it the feel of a violent music video at times. Preposterously fun to watch, it just doesn\'t have much of a story at its disposal, not to mention all the over-the-top bloodletting and mayhem eventually becomes redundant. Savvy, indestructible Reeves looks right at home, and delivers many of his lines with a sardonic wit. **½'
 "": 18\nReview: When the story begins, John (Keanu Reeves) has just lost his wife. After her death, he's a bit lost but tries to rebuild his life. One day, he's getting gas and a young Russian-American punk notices Wick's classic car...and tries to buy it off him. But Wick isn't interested and declines. Soon, the punk arrives at Wick's home with some goons where they surprise him--beating him senseless, destroying his stuff, killing his dog and stealing his car! This is when you then learn that Wick is a super-assassin....and the punk chose the wrong guy to attack. The jerk's father is a big-time Russian mobster....and it's a contest to see who will win...the mobster and his gang or Wick on his own. Considering there are (so far) two MORE John Wick films, it pretty much seems certain who will win this battle.""]","John Wick portrays the criminal underworld as a place where powerful people know each other and show respect if you are connected. It is depicted as a world filled with ruthless characters who push John Wick to be even more ruthless, creating a dynamic of how far is too far. This setting is unique in action films because it focuses on the consequences of revenge and the boundaries of morality within the criminal underworld.","John Wick portrays a criminal underworld where powerful people know and respect those who are connected. The protagonist, John Wick, is a rare killer who has found peace but is forced back into violence when his peace is disrupted. The film presents clear motives for John and his adversaries, making the plot straightforward. The action sequences in the film are directed by Reeves' stuntman from The Matrix, resulting in smooth and fluid sequences that outshine other action films. The movie features a blend of character actors, including familiar faces from The Matrix and The Wire, adding to the overall enjoyment of the film. Despite its dark moments, John Wick is described as fun and recommended for action fans seeking something different from typical movies in the genre.",0.9999999999916667,1.0,2.9606430530548096,4414
How does the focus on hand-to-hand combat in JOHN WICK 3 enhance the movie?,"[': 19\nReview: The inevitable third chapter of the JOHN WICK franchise continues on a high with the same quality as the last. In fact, this may just pip that one to the post to be the best JOHN WICK yet. The pacing is spot on and the plotting is measured by a huge amount of action sequences, all of which fizz and crackle with skill and energy. The movie hits the ground running as Keanu faces off with a hulking character in a library and then Triads in a weapon shop, but what really amazes here is the sheer inventiveness of the non-repetitive action. There are horse and motorbike chases, a Moroccan brawl with fighting dogs, alongside the massive action of the climax. There also seems to be a greater emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, featuring the likes of RAID actors and old-timer Mark Dacascos, which is a real pleasure as the choreography is top-notch. In terms of sheer enjoyment, this is a film hard to beat, and to criticise it at all is unnecessary. Bring on the fourth!'

 ': 0\nReview: It is 5 years since the first John Wick film - one that took me by surprise by how silly it was as a narrative, but yet how well it delivered action sequences. The second film was only 2 years ago, and it raised the stakes and went from a man seeking revenge on another group of people, into one where the world was filled with assassins, popping up from everywhere all the time. I remember ending that film feeling like it had gone too far but that the third would probably do more of that. True enough, Parabellum (""prepare for war"") sees the whole world filled with assassins, and a huge administrative system around them - but yet the whole lot of them can\'t seem to cause John Wick too much trouble. As with the first film, this expands the world more than it can bear, and although it looks cool at times, the world makes no sense whatsoever and it hurts the film the more it relies on it (which it does as it expands it).'
 ': 3\nReview: John wick has a very simple revenge story. It can be summarized as ""Keanu gets angry and shoots bad guys"" but what makes it special? Directed by Chad Stahelski who\'s a stunt specialist boy does it show because the main selling point in the film are some real virtuoso action sequences, well made choreographies. Unlike today\'s action movies, it doesn\'t use quick-cuts or shaky cameras actually see what\'s going on.'
 ': 0\nReview: No doubt about it, ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is a slick action thriller, but man, oh man, how can any one person absorb that kind of punishment? John (Keanu Reeves) gets shot, stabbed and hit by cars multiple times and postures a limp now and then to indicate he might have gotten just a little bit hurt. Besides that, he almost never makes a wrong move when hunted by dozens of assassins all at the same time. Okay, I get it, Reeves is the star of the picture and has to come out on top, but I\'d like a little more credibility put into these kinds of stories. But I guess that\'s the whole point, suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours and just go with all of the over the top action the film makers can put together.'
 "": 9\nReview: At first glance, John Wick sounds like a terrible film on paper but with the slickness of Keanu Reeves' performance as the titular character and the sheer brilliance in its action sequences, this marks the best action film of the year and one of the absolute best in the past decade. Following a brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved dog murdered by thugs from his past, John Wick vows revenge on the ones who have taken what he loves most. Like I said, on paper, this seems like a direct-to-DVD slopfest starring John Cena but as a film with Keanu Reeves as the lead, it marks the very welcomed return for Reeves to the genre. John Wick is insanely fun, violently brutal and an overall romp especially for those disappointed by The Expendables 3. John Wick is propelled by Tarantino-esque dialog mixed with the swagger of action stars from the 70s. Reeves literally emulates cool in this film and does it with such confidence, that we don't even doubt the character...even when he kills countless bad guys with extreme force in some utterly ridiculous and implausible situations. We don't doubt it for a minute. This is EXACTLY what you want out of an action film. It is briskly paced, brilliantly shot and meticulously choreographed and keeps you wanting more and more. The supporting cast filled with the likes of John Legiuzamo, Ian McShane, and Willen Dafoe also keeps this film very interesting. These guys don't play good guys, hell, John Wick by traditional standards would be a bad guy in any other film. Every character is more ruthless than the next and pushes John Wick to be more ruthless than they are, creating a very cool dynamic between the character and the plot regarding the idea of how far is too far? However, don't expect some revelation from John Wick regarding the morality of bad and evil. This film wants you entertained and does so with brute force, it never lets up, not even for a second. One scene in particular that will have your blood pumping is a showdown between thugs and Wick in a nightclub. This action sequence remains the best in the film and will have you grasping your theater seat because of the sheer intensity of it. Overall, John Wick is slick, violent fun that turns into a remarkable, surprising film that will catch you off guard. It is THAT good. I highly recommend this film to action buffs especially but I'm sure those who just like a good movie will love it as well.""
 ': 2\nReview: The first three John Wick films came in fairly quick succession, with only five years between the first and third chapters, each film trying to top the one before in terms of wild set pieces. For me, it all became a bit too much, the action rapidly becoming too frenetic and over-the-top. By Parabellum (part three), I had had enough.'
 ': 24\nReview: John Wick: Chapter 4 is almost three hours of Keanu Reeves engaged in a gunfight, bookended with meaningless dialog-in-place-of-plot, and a lot of people being thrown down stairs. Of all the ""Wick"" movies, this is clearly the weakest one yet. Was anything added to the overall Wick-universe narrative? No. Did we see a whole lot of inconsequential people die? Yes. Did Keanu Reeves say ""yeah"" a lot? Yes.'

 "": 19\nReview: John Wick: Chapter 4 picks up where Chapter 3: Parabellum left off. As has been the tradition in the sequels to this beloved martial arts action franchise the action starts from the very inception of the film's opening, and lasts until the curtain falls. JW4 is no exception to that rule. What it does do is improve on the prior installment, and solidify Keanu Reeves as the greatest martial arts action star of all time. If you don't accept that notion, then you must accept the fact that it solidifies Reeves and Director, Chad Stahelski, as the greatest martial arts action pairing of modern times.""

 ': 9\nReview: ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is an American movie from this year (2017). Experienced visual effects artist Stahelski and Kolstad returned from the very first Wick film to work on the script/direction here too, so the premise with regard to people working behind the camera is there. And in front of the camera we see familiar faces again, people that survived the film, like most of all Keanu Reeves playing the central character. This is a really long film at over 2 hours and at this runtime, it is considerably longer than the first. And there is a lot other stuff different compared to the original. Most has to do with the fun component. I think the first film was a great fun watch from start to finish while offering emotion nonetheless and also delivering in the crime and drama genres. And action too, but I don\'t care too much about that. This genre is also basically the only one where this new movie delivers as the first 30 minutes are truly packed with action. It gets less afterward, but there is no denying that it was still all about the action and nothing else.'

Most action movies you see is filled with ridiculous amounts of shaky-cam, fast edits and way over-the-top fights. This is perfect. You can see all action clear as day, and by god the stuns in this film are extraordinary. Why the Academy Awards don't award talent like this is beyond me. There were times that I wondered if they had used CGI, because someone nuts must be willing to throw themselves from motorbikes and through glass. But whatever case it is, its a dam joy to watch.""

The Tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. The only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub, eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club, but then again it's a shady nightclub for high table people.

How has the John Wick franchise contributed to the revitalization of the action genre in Hollywood?,"[': 5\nReview: The first John Wick film was special because it broke a mold of sorts. It went against certain action film conventions - the hero was not a muscle bound hulk like a Schwarzenegger or Stallone, the action was super fast paced, the plot was basic and straighforward, but introduced some unique elements, and there was something a bit unique and stylish about the film. John Wick was cool.'
 "": 18\nReview: Ever since the original John Wick, the franchise has set a standard of what action in Hollywood should be. Thanks to Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeve's knowledge of the technical aspects of shooting action, they've been able to deliver expertly choreographed, shot, and edited action films that are now the go to as examples of great action filmmaking. And so, the expectations for the fourth film were fairly high, especially as it became more apparent this was not only the culmination of everything before it, but a whopping 169 minutes long. Rest assured, however, that it delivers in spades. Everything we have come to know and love is here, but with an infusion of creativity like we haven't seen from the franchise yet.""

 "": 11\nReview: JOHN WICK is a rare example of Hollywood getting things spot-on when it comes to creating the near-perfect action film. JOHN WICK is a relentless, pulse-pounding thriller that has plenty of similarity to the Liam Neeson classic TAKEN, albeit with a more simplistic (and also more emotionally intense) plot line. This is the kind of lean, pared-down film-making that's all about intensity and momentum. It sits well with classic international fare like POINT BLANK, SLEEPLESS NIGHT, MEA CULPA, THE MAN FROM NOWHERE, and THE RAID films.""
 "": 17\nReview: Stuntman turned writer/director Chad Stahelski struck gold with his 2014 surprise hit John Wick. It was somewhat of a comeback for the legendary Keanu Reeves and reinvigorated the action genre. Since then it's become THE action juggernaut franchise. Now we are on number 4 and while usually things get redone with that amount of sequels, this film innovates and thrills to new heights in an absolute epic.""
 ': 9\nReview: ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is an American movie from this year (2017). Experienced visual effects artist Stahelski and Kolstad returned from the very first Wick film to work on the script/direction here too, so the premise with regard to people working behind the camera is there. And in front of the camera we see familiar faces again, people that survived the film, like most of all Keanu Reeves playing the central character. This is a really long film at over 2 hours and at this runtime, it is considerably longer than the first. And there is a lot other stuff different compared to the original. Most has to do with the fun component. I think the first film was a great fun watch from start to finish while offering emotion nonetheless and also delivering in the crime and drama genres. And action too, but I don\'t care too much about that. This genre is also basically the only one where this new movie delivers as the first 30 minutes are truly packed with action. It gets less afterward, but there is no denying that it was still all about the action and nothing else.'
 ': 3\nReview: John wick has a very simple revenge story. It can be summarized as ""Keanu gets angry and shoots bad guys"" but what makes it special? Directed by Chad Stahelski who\'s a stunt specialist boy does it show because the main selling point in the film are some real virtuoso action sequences, well made choreographies. Unlike today\'s action movies, it doesn\'t use quick-cuts or shaky cameras actually see what\'s going on.'
 "": 10\nReview: Most American action flicks released these days have poor screenplays and overuse computer-generated imagery. The John Wick franchise is one of the few exceptions, along with Mission Impossible. These franchises keep getting better with every entry.

 ': 22\nReview: John Wick is one of my favourite recent years action movie and the second one pick up right where the first one left. The action is sharp, well filmed, no bad shaky cams and jump cuts like a certain bad action movie i saw recently. Its so refreshing to see everything and admire the practical stunt work.'
 ': 17\nReview: There are actually quite a handful reasons why ""John Wick"" could have become a failure. The two directors have never made a film before and almost exclusively worked in the stunt department so far. The writer is not exactly experienced either. Lead actor Keanu Reeves usually scores more through boyish charm than through realistic portrayal of gritty badass characters. And the genre of crime action thrillers rarely delivers in terms of real significance. Still it became a very good film. The main reason for that is probably that it does not attempt to be anything of great cinematic value, does not try to teach groundbreaking stories on moral, loyalty or betrayal. Instead, Derek Kolstad\'s script goes for a gutsy revenge thriller that is not even hurt by its occasional predictability.'
 ': 0\nReview: It is 5 years since the first John Wick film - one that took me by surprise by how silly it was as a narrative, but yet how well it delivered action sequences. The second film was only 2 years ago, and it raised the stakes and went from a man seeking revenge on another group of people, into one where the world was filled with assassins, popping up from everywhere all the time. I remember ending that film feeling like it had gone too far but that the third would probably do more of that. True enough, Parabellum (""prepare for war"") sees the whole world filled with assassins, and a huge administrative system around them - but yet the whole lot of them can\'t seem to cause John Wick too much trouble. As with the first film, this expands the world more than it can bear, and although it looks cool at times, the world makes no sense whatsoever and it hurts the film the more it relies on it (which it does as it expands it).'
 "": 16\nReview: John Wick 3 is without a doubt the best action movie to have come out in a few years. And its so surprising and refreshing to see that movies like this still exist. Most action movies you see is filled with ridiculous amounts of shaky-cam, fast edits and way over-the-top fights. This is perfect. You can see all action clear as day, and by god the stuns in this film are extraordinary. Why the Academy Awards don't award talent like this is beyond me. There were times that I wondered if they had used CGI, because someone nuts must be willing to throw themselves from motorbikes and through glass. But whatever case it is, its a dam joy to watch.""

In fact, this may just pip that one to the post to be the best JOHN WICK yet. The pacing is spot on and the plotting is measured by a huge amount of action sequences, all of which fizz and crackle with skill and energy. The movie hits the ground running as Keanu faces off with a hulking character in a library and then Triads in a weapon shop, but what really amazes here is the sheer inventiveness of the non-repetitive action. There are horse and motorbike chases, a Moroccan brawl with fighting dogs, alongside the massive action of the climax. There also seems to be a greater emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, featuring the likes of RAID actors and old-timer Mark Dacascos, which is a real pleasure as the choreography is top-notch. In terms of sheer enjoyment, this is a film hard to beat, and to criticise it at all is unnecessary. Bring on the fourth!'

 "": 6\nReview: Assassin John Wick is referred to as Baba Yaga in this third chapter, suggesting that he is, in fact, a supernatural being; his ability to evade death, appear and disappear like a ninja from a Godfrey Ho film, and move with lightning fast reflexes despite being in his mid-fifties confirms this fact, in my opinion. Unfortunately, Wick's invincibility means that the many action scenes in Parabellum are largely devoid of excitement, the only outcome being that Wick is still alive and all of his enemies are dead.""
 "": 20\nReview: John Wick is something special. It takes as much time setting up elaborate action sequences as it does the world with which it all takes place in. And what a world it is. It reminds me of Millers Crossing and it is cooler than any other recent attempt at noir. We are shown a criminal underworld where, if you are connected, many powerful people know who you are and show you respect. John Wick was connected but he got out. He is the rare killer who has found peace, and he is grateful for that peace. Some young kids steal that from him and he does what he does best, he wages a one man war against the Russian Mafia. It might sound like the film takes quite a leap but it all makes sense. The motives of John and the people who get in the way of his bullets are all very clear, even if it does come across as rather simple. That's the plot at it's most basic. Then there's the action. The film is directed by Reeve's stuntman from The Matrix, so this guy knows action. There are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films and their quick cuts to shame. Keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the film and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is that we have not seen him like this before. Along the way are plenty of character actors, fans of The Matrix and The Wire will recognize a few people then there are more obvious ones like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe. Everyone seems to be having a good time. That is another plus for this movie. It get's dark at times but overall it is quite fun, not very chipper, but fun. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I believe it is a must see for action fans and for anyone looking for something a bit different from the usual fare.""

 "": 9\nReview: At first glance, John Wick sounds like a terrible film on paper but with the slickness of Keanu Reeves' performance as the titular character and the sheer brilliance in its action sequences, this marks the best action film of the year and one of the absolute best in the past decade. Following a brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved dog murdered by thugs from his past, John Wick vows revenge on the ones who have taken what he loves most. Like I said, on paper, this seems like a direct-to-DVD slopfest starring John Cena but as a film with Keanu Reeves as the lead, it marks the very welcomed return for Reeves to the genre. John Wick is insanely fun, violently brutal and an overall romp especially for those disappointed by The Expendables 3. John Wick is propelled by Tarantino-esque dialog mixed with the swagger of action stars from the 70s. Reeves literally emulates cool in this film and does it with such confidence, that we don't even doubt the character...even when he kills countless bad guys with extreme force in some utterly ridiculous and implausible situations. We don't doubt it for a minute. This is EXACTLY what you want out of an action film. It is briskly paced, brilliantly shot and meticulously choreographed and keeps you wanting more and more. The supporting cast filled with the likes of John Legiuzamo, Ian McShane, and Willen Dafoe also keeps this film very interesting. These guys don't play good guys, hell, John Wick by traditional standards would be a bad guy in any other film. Every character is more ruthless than the next and pushes John Wick to be more ruthless than they are, creating a very cool dynamic between the character and the plot regarding the idea of how far is too far? However, don't expect some revelation from John Wick regarding the morality of bad and evil. This film wants you entertained and does so with brute force, it never lets up, not even for a second. One scene in particular that will have your blood pumping is a showdown between thugs and Wick in a nightclub. This action sequence remains the best in the film and will have you grasping your theater seat because of the sheer intensity of it. Overall, John Wick is slick, violent fun that turns into a remarkable, surprising film that will catch you off guard. It is THAT good. I highly recommend this film to action buffs especially but I'm sure those who just like a good movie will love it as well.""
 ': 9\nReview: ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is an American movie from this year (2017). Experienced visual effects artist Stahelski and Kolstad returned from the very first Wick film to work on the script/direction here too, so the premise with regard to people working behind the camera is there. And in front of the camera we see familiar faces again, people that survived the film, like most of all Keanu Reeves playing the central character. This is a really long film at over 2 hours and at this runtime, it is considerably longer than the first. And there is a lot other stuff different compared to the original. Most has to do with the fun component. I think the first film was a great fun watch from start to finish while offering emotion nonetheless and also delivering in the crime and drama genres. And action too, but I don\'t care too much about that. This genre is also basically the only one where this new movie delivers as the first 30 minutes are truly packed with action. It gets less afterward, but there is no denying that it was still all about the action and nothing else.'
 "": 0\nReview: The best way I can describe John Wick is to picture Taken but instead of Liam Neeson it's Keanu Reeves and instead of his daughter it's his dog. That's essentially the plot of the movie. John Wick (Reeves) is out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him. It's a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action movies get convoluted, they get bad i.e. A Good Day to Die Hard. John Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. John Wick succeeds in its simplicity.""
 ': 3\nReview: John wick has a very simple revenge story. It can be summarized as ""Keanu gets angry and shoots bad guys"" but what makes it special? Directed by Chad Stahelski who\'s a stunt specialist boy does it show because the main selling point in the film are some real virtuoso action sequences, well made choreographies. Unlike today\'s action movies, it doesn\'t use quick-cuts or shaky cameras actually see what\'s going on.'

 "": 8\nReview: In this 2nd installment of John Wick, the stylish visual and hard core action returns twice the level of the first film. So prepare for another suspenseful and cliffhanging sequences flow from this action movie when you watch this. The story goes deeper and the action scenes were incredibly entertaining! The revenge theme was still part of the movie's plot but this time the focus is the personal backstab of Wick. Keanu Reeves delivers again a notable performance as a titular character. This film is what a sequel movie should be - justifying the connection to the predecessor movie that made it successful by expanding its story and maintaining the elements that made it a superb film. The ending of this film opened the possibility of many more franchise of this movie.""

John Wick 2 doesn't have the ability to sneak up on me unannounced, which does work against it, but this is not what hurts it the most.""
 "": 11\nReview: JOHN WICK is a rare example of Hollywood getting things spot-on when it comes to creating the near-perfect action film. JOHN WICK is a relentless, pulse-pounding thriller that has plenty of similarity to the Liam Neeson classic TAKEN, albeit with a more simplistic (and also more emotionally intense) plot line. This is the kind of lean, pared-down film-making that's all about intensity and momentum. It sits well with classic international fare like POINT BLANK, SLEEPLESS NIGHT, MEA CULPA, THE MAN FROM NOWHERE, and THE RAID films.""
 "": 18\nReview: Ever since the original John Wick, the franchise has set a standard of what action in Hollywood should be. Thanks to Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeve's knowledge of the technical aspects of shooting action, they've been able to deliver expertly choreographed, shot, and edited action films that are now the go to as examples of great action filmmaking. And so, the expectations for the fourth film were fairly high, especially as it became more apparent this was not only the culmination of everything before it, but a whopping 169 minutes long. Rest assured, however, that it delivers in spades. Everything we have come to know and love is here, but with an infusion of creativity like we haven't seen from the franchise yet.""

Preposterously fun to watch, it just doesn\'t have much of a story at its disposal, not to mention all the over-the-top bloodletting and mayhem eventually becomes redundant.

What are some common cliches associated with the portrayal of a retired hit-man in Hollywood films?,"[': 22\nReview: All the below are non-creative copying of past movies (done many times before): 1. Opening scene - alarm clock going off. 2. Coffee brewing. 3. Casket being lowered; raining for effect; long shot of cemetery showing stranger watching. 4. Afterwards, solemn wake party. 5. Mystery package at door. From? Of course. 6. Bad guys are (Guess what nationality?) $1000 if you have no idea. And, of course, are as stereotypic as cut-out doll figures. 7. Older hot cars and lots of squealing tires, burning rubber (or synthetic equivalent). You would think Reeves character would be past that 17 year old\'s infatuation. 8. Master killer still has an arsenal hidden away, why? Anticipated this precise series of events unfolding many years earlier. Or, nostalgia. 9. Reeves is covered in tats, of course, to show us toughness. Russian iconic tats no less - oops! 10. Dozen (cheaper that way) bad guys need some skill training because they\'re slow, dumb and can\'t seem to shoot at a target a few feet away and always walk around corners without looking first. 11. Been done before ""cleaning crew"" just a call away to dispose of waste animal tissue (human of course). They always look the same in these movies. 12. Usual cheap scene filler, and getting really tedious, helicopter shot of city and car traveling on road below (even did a several times). 13. Background music the usual rock/blues/alter/jazz sound. 14. Barely clothed chicks tossed in for the male viewer and one to be bad. 15. Same old club scenes with strobes. 16. Usual wharf/dock driving and shooting scenes. 17. Now for the fun part and a new record surpassing the past record of 65 kills by one individual in a movie (can\'t remember the movie from a couple of years ago but it had that Detroit blighted semi-deserted projects, public housing/towers backdrop with this guy going through the floors shooting all the druggies). The new record for a movie is (drum roll) 73 by Reeves and 8 by others = 81 (maybe more, hard to keep track at times).'

Answer, not possible, only in this movie and series. How many times could the dog man have killed Wick? Many. So no other assassin could? Why would the table head get Caine to kill Wick when he knows he won't. You can challenge the head to a duel as a rule, but they only assigned a head for the first time ever in this movie? WTF? And then the head can select a replacement? And he selects a blind man. All Wick had to do was to stand on the side or drop down and he wouldn't get shot. I think everyone knew Wick didn't shoot in the last round, except for the stupid head bad guy. This is not an action movie, it's a fantasy.""

That settled, John is called on to pay off an old debt by helping Ian McShane take over the Assassin's Guild by flying around to Italy, Canada and Manhattan and killing what seems like hundreds of assassins.""

I originally skipped out on the film as I felt that the trailers only showed an assassin story that I felt I've seen before. As far as I'm concerned, I made a big mistake. Before seeing the sequel, I felt it was important to watch the first one. I rented it on Amazon Prime and I was shock by what I saw; a dark, stylish, and fun action movie that is doing it's own thing. Though I've seen plenty stories about revenge (The Count of Monte Cristo and Moby Dick being the prime examples), I can't recall one over someone's pet being murdered.""
 "": 18\nReview: When the story begins, John (Keanu Reeves) has just lost his wife. After her death, he's a bit lost but tries to rebuild his life. One day, he's getting gas and a young Russian-American punk notices Wick's classic car...and tries to buy it off him. But Wick isn't interested and declines. Soon, the punk arrives at Wick's home with some goons where they surprise him--beating him senseless, destroying his stuff, killing his dog and stealing his car! This is when you then learn that Wick is a super-assassin....and the punk chose the wrong guy to attack. The jerk's father is a big-time Russian mobster....and it's a contest to see who will win...the mobster and his gang or Wick on his own. Considering there are (so far) two MORE John Wick films, it pretty much seems certain who will win this battle.""
 "": 18\nReview: And all of this equals boredom. 2 hours of the same thing over and over. A movie for young teens who judge movies as they do video games; the more kills, the better. After the 30th guy got his head blown off, it became totally boring to me. John Wick gets hit by a car 6 times, gets thrown down a flight of stairs 10 times, gets punched and kicked 500 times...and yet he keeps fighting. He fights 30 guys at the same time, with a gun or without, and he always wins. There is zero plot, zero character development, zero drama...it's all mindless action. And repetitive. Fistfights, guns, and cars. Nothing else. Nothing creative. Well they tried to be creative a couple times...like wasting 15 minutes with a woman doing an elaborate yet gross suicide...and for no reason other than to slap something 'original' up on the screen. It was completely pointless. How this movie is rated highly is beyond me. Like I say, it must be young teens who judge movies on number of kills. PS - I'm not exaggerating. The main bad guy simply puts a message into his phone, and within 3 minutes, literally the entire city is out to kill John Wick. So he has to fight 30 guys at a time, killing 500 guys within 20 minutes or so. Mind-numbingly stupid and boring.""
 "": 10\nReview: Most American action flicks released these days have poor screenplays and overuse computer-generated imagery. The John Wick franchise is one of the few exceptions, along with Mission Impossible. These franchises keep getting better with every entry. Hollywood can make action masterpieces, but Marvel has greater demand, so that's what we get most of. It's a shame.""
 "": 1\nReview: It looks as if the filmmakers realized that the public was sick of certain movies.

It is a very fun, straightforward action movie with an 80's sensibility. It's nice to see Keanu doing these types of roles again. It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves movies. Keanu Reeves is a bad ass what a great action packed blood packed film. Movies should really learn from this on how to make a decent action film, especially with the crap we are getting today like escape plan bullet to the head and such. This film to me is the greatest action film to come out in this century. Keanu was phenomenal the action was so fast paced and exciting my jaw literally dropped as Keanu took out all the bad guys! I personally think this film is better then all Taken films combined. It was simply brilliant, it was made for 20 million dollars and I am glad it made 40 million in the US. I think this film deserved to make 100 million!""
 "": 9\nReview: At first glance, John Wick sounds like a terrible film on paper but with the slickness of Keanu Reeves' performance as the titular character and the sheer brilliance in its action sequences, this marks the best action film of the year and one of the absolute best in the past decade. Following a brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved dog murdered by thugs from his past, John Wick vows revenge on the ones who have taken what he loves most. Like I said, on paper, this seems like a direct-to-DVD slopfest starring John Cena but as a film with Keanu Reeves as the lead, it marks the very welcomed return for Reeves to the genre. John Wick is insanely fun, violently brutal and an overall romp especially for those disappointed by The Expendables 3. John Wick is propelled by Tarantino-esque dialog mixed with the swagger of action stars from the 70s. Reeves literally emulates cool in this film and does it with such confidence, that we don't even doubt the character...even when he kills countless bad guys with extreme force in some utterly ridiculous and implausible situations. We don't doubt it for a minute. This is EXACTLY what you want out of an action film. It is briskly paced, brilliantly shot and meticulously choreographed and keeps you wanting more and more. The supporting cast filled with the likes of John Legiuzamo, Ian McShane, and Willen Dafoe also keeps this film very interesting. These guys don't play good guys, hell, John Wick by traditional standards would be a bad guy in any other film. Every character is more ruthless than the next and pushes John Wick to be more ruthless than they are, creating a very cool dynamic between the character and the plot regarding the idea of how far is too far? However, don't expect some revelation from John Wick regarding the morality of bad and evil. This film wants you entertained and does so with brute force, it never lets up, not even for a second. One scene in particular that will have your blood pumping is a showdown between thugs and Wick in a nightclub. This action sequence remains the best in the film and will have you grasping your theater seat because of the sheer intensity of it. Overall, John Wick is slick, violent fun that turns into a remarkable, surprising film that will catch you off guard. It is THAT good. I highly recommend this film to action buffs especially but I'm sure those who just like a good movie will love it as well.""
 "": 20\nReview: John Wick is something special. It takes as much time setting up elaborate action sequences as it does the world with which it all takes place in. And what a world it is. It reminds me of Millers Crossing and it is cooler than any other recent attempt at noir. We are shown a criminal underworld where, if you are connected, many powerful people know who you are and show you respect. John Wick was connected but he got out. He is the rare killer who has found peace, and he is grateful for that peace. Some young kids steal that from him and he does what he does best, he wages a one man war against the Russian Mafia. It might sound like the film takes quite a leap but it all makes sense. The motives of John and the people who get in the way of his bullets are all very clear, even if it does come across as rather simple. That's the plot at it's most basic. Then there's the action. The film is directed by Reeve's stuntman from The Matrix, so this guy knows action. There are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films and their quick cuts to shame. Keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the film and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is that we have not seen him like this before. Along the way are plenty of character actors, fans of The Matrix and The Wire will recognize a few people then there are more obvious ones like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe. Everyone seems to be having a good time. That is another plus for this movie. It get's dark at times but overall it is quite fun, not very chipper, but fun. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I believe it is a must see for action fans and for anyone looking for something a bit different from the usual fare.""
 "": 12\nReview: If there's an equivalent of classical orchestra for untamed unapologetically brutal carnage, there's no doubt it'd be John Wick.

 "": 0\nReview: The best way I can describe John Wick is to picture Taken but instead of Liam Neeson it's Keanu Reeves and instead of his daughter it's his dog. That's essentially the plot of the movie. John Wick (Reeves) is out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him. It's a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action movies get convoluted, they get bad i.e. A Good Day to Die Hard. John Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. John Wick succeeds in its simplicity.""

Failing that, the gory mayhem had better be something special - something that breaks new ground in terms of action cinema. John Wick Chapter 2 is relentlessly violent, Keanu Reeves' eponymous hitman laying waste to almost everyone he crosses paths with, once again finishing most victims with a shot to the head, but the action is simply more of the same, director Chad Stahelski bringing nothing new to the table.""

In fact, this may just pip that one to the post to be the best JOHN WICK yet. The pacing is spot on and the plotting is measured by a huge amount of action sequences, all of which fizz and crackle with skill and energy. The movie hits the ground running as Keanu faces off with a hulking character in a library and then Triads in a weapon shop, but what really amazes here is the sheer inventiveness of the non-repetitive action. There are horse and motorbike chases, a Moroccan brawl with fighting dogs, alongside the massive action of the climax. There also seems to be a greater emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, featuring the likes of RAID actors and old-timer Mark Dacascos, which is a real pleasure as the choreography is top-notch. In terms of sheer enjoyment, this is a film hard to beat, and to criticise it at all is unnecessary.

 ': 9\nReview: ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is an American movie from this year (2017). Experienced visual effects artist Stahelski and Kolstad returned from the very first Wick film to work on the script/direction here too, so the premise with regard to people working behind the camera is there. And in front of the camera we see familiar faces again, people that survived the film, like most of all Keanu Reeves playing the central character. This is a really long film at over 2 hours and at this runtime, it is considerably longer than the first. And there is a lot other stuff different compared to the original. Most has to do with the fun component. I think the first film was a great fun watch from start to finish while offering emotion nonetheless and also delivering in the crime and drama genres. And action too, but I don\'t care too much about that. This genre is also basically the only one where this new movie delivers as the first 30 minutes are truly packed with action. It gets less afterward, but there is no denying that it was still all about the action and nothing else.'
 ': 0\nReview: It is 5 years since the first John Wick film - one that took me by surprise by how silly it was as a narrative, but yet how well it delivered action sequences. The second film was only 2 years ago, and it raised the stakes and went from a man seeking revenge on another group of people, into one where the world was filled with assassins, popping up from everywhere all the time. I remember ending that film feeling like it had gone too far but that the third would probably do more of that. True enough, Parabellum (""prepare for war"") sees the whole world filled with assassins, and a huge administrative system around them - but yet the whole lot of them can\'t seem to cause John Wick too much trouble. As with the first film, this expands the world more than it can bear, and although it looks cool at times, the world makes no sense whatsoever and it hurts the film the more it relies on it (which it does as it expands it).'
 "": 6\nReview: In 2014, a Keanu Reeves revenge thriller John Wick became a surprise hit. I originally skipped out on the film as I felt that the trailers only showed an assassin story that I felt I've seen before. As far as I'm concerned, I made a big mistake. Before seeing the sequel, I felt it was important to watch the first one. I rented it on Amazon Prime and I was shock by what I saw; a dark, stylish, and fun action movie that is doing it's own thing. Though I've seen plenty stories about revenge (The Count of Monte Cristo and Moby Dick being the prime examples), I can't recall one over someone's pet being murdered.""

1. The sequel, John Wick 2, has a deeper story that focuses on the personal backstab of Wick, while the original movie was more centered on revenge for his dog.
2. John Wick 2 expands the action sequences and maintains the stylish visual elements, delivering more suspenseful and cliffhanging moments compared to the first film.
3. The sequel is considerably longer in runtime, over 2 hours, compared to the original.
4. Some reviewers noted that the first film was more fun to watch from start to finish, with a good mix of emotion, crime, drama, and action, while the sequel focused more on action and less on other elements like emotion.
5. The sequel introduces new locations like Italy, Canada, and Manhattan, expanding the world of assassins and the Assassin's Guild.
6. John Wick 2 is considered by some to be a rare sequel that is better than the original movie, with improved action sequences and set design.

What causes the lack of depth in successful crime action thrillers?,"[': 17\nReview: There are actually quite a handful reasons why ""John Wick"" could have become a failure. The two directors have never made a film before and almost exclusively worked in the stunt department so far. The writer is not exactly experienced either. Lead actor Keanu Reeves usually scores more through boyish charm than through realistic portrayal of gritty badass characters. And the genre of crime action thrillers rarely delivers in terms of real significance. Still it became a very good film. The main reason for that is probably that it does not attempt to be anything of great cinematic value, does not try to teach groundbreaking stories on moral, loyalty or betrayal. Instead, Derek Kolstad\'s script goes for a gutsy revenge thriller that is not even hurt by its occasional predictability.'

John Wick gets hit by a car 6 times, gets thrown down a flight of stairs 10 times, gets punched and kicked 500 times...and yet he keeps fighting. He fights 30 guys at the same time, with a gun or without, and he always wins. There is zero plot, zero character development, zero drama...it's all mindless action. And repetitive. Fistfights, guns, and cars. Nothing else. Nothing creative. Well they tried to be creative a couple times...like wasting 15 minutes with a woman doing an elaborate yet gross suicide...and for no reason other than to slap something 'original' up on the screen. It was completely pointless. How this movie is rated highly is beyond me. Like I say, it must be young teens who judge movies on number of kills. PS - I'm not exaggerating. The main bad guy simply puts a message into his phone, and within 3 minutes, literally the entire city is out to kill John Wick.

All the fighting sequences just like Shaw Brothers' 1970s poor and laughable Hong Kong martial art movies, heavily choreographically staged, looked so forced and fake. Every kill was not killed with one bullets but many, yet the handguns seemed equipped with endless bullets, bang, bang, bang, even the fallen guys already dead, but still needed to be shot several times more to increase the violent sound effect. I don't know what's the purpose of making these 4th Chapter, and I think the 1st Chapter only needed a following 2nd Chapter to end it, but what the heck, brainless young viewers need bloody fights, more dead bodies, ridiculous screenplay with clueless storyline, no real plots or real story really needed, just created something like violent video games.""

Slow and ambiguous at first, but reveals more as it goes along, and once it kicks into gear it rarely lets up with plenty of stylized, visceral action scenes, an impressive arsenal of weaponry, plus sly direction and editing that give it the feel of a violent music video at times. Preposterously fun to watch, it just doesn\'t have much of a story at its disposal, not to mention all the over-the-top bloodletting and mayhem eventually becomes redundant. Savvy, indestructible Reeves looks right at home, and delivers many of his lines with a sardonic wit. **½'

Dozen (cheaper that way) bad guys need some skill training because they\'re slow, dumb and can\'t seem to shoot at a target a few feet away and always walk around corners without looking first. 11. Been done before ""cleaning crew"" just a call away to dispose of waste animal tissue (human of course). They always look the same in these movies. 12. Usual cheap scene filler, and getting really tedious, helicopter shot of city and car traveling on road below (even did a several times). 13. Background music the usual rock/blues/alter/jazz sound. 14. Barely clothed chicks tossed in for the male viewer and one to be bad. 15. Same old club scenes with strobes. 16. Usual wharf/dock driving and shooting scenes. 17. Now for the fun part and a new record surpassing the past record of 65 kills by one individual in a movie (can\'t remember the movie from a couple of years ago but it had that Detroit blighted semi-deserted projects, public housing/towers backdrop with this guy going through the floors shooting all the druggies). The new record for a movie is (drum roll) 73 by Reeves and 8 by others = 81 (maybe more, hard to keep track at times).'
 ': 4\nReview: Though he no longer has a taste for wet work, retired assassin and ""Boogeyman"" John Wick has suffered a personal tragedy that\'s left a huge void in his life. When he and his dog (really the last meaningful thing he has left) fall victim to a scummy group of Russian mobsters, he emerges from his shell with vengeance on his mind. Slow and ambiguous at first, but reveals more as it goes along, and once it kicks into gear it rarely lets up with plenty of stylized, visceral action scenes, an impressive arsenal of weaponry, plus sly direction and editing that give it the feel of a violent music video at times. Preposterously fun to watch, it just doesn\'t have much of a story at its disposal, not to mention all the over-the-top bloodletting and mayhem eventually becomes redundant. Savvy, indestructible Reeves looks right at home, and delivers many of his lines with a sardonic wit. **½'
 "": 6\nReview: In 2014, a Keanu Reeves revenge thriller John Wick became a surprise hit. I originally skipped out on the film as I felt that the trailers only showed an assassin story that I felt I've seen before. As far as I'm concerned, I made a big mistake. Before seeing the sequel, I felt it was important to watch the first one. I rented it on Amazon Prime and I was shock by what I saw; a dark, stylish, and fun action movie that is doing it's own thing. Though I've seen plenty stories about revenge (The Count of Monte Cristo and Moby Dick being the prime examples), I can't recall one over someone's pet being murdered.""

One day, he's getting gas and a young Russian-American punk notices Wick's classic car...and tries to buy it off him. But Wick isn't interested and declines. Soon, the punk arrives at Wick's home with some goons where they surprise him--beating him senseless, destroying his stuff, killing his dog and stealing his car! This is when you then learn that Wick is a super-assassin....and the punk chose the wrong guy to attack. The jerk's father is a big-time Russian mobster....and it's a contest to see who will win...the mobster and his gang or Wick on his own.

It\'s a shame that Keanu Reeves is supposed to be one of the nicest guys to work\nwith in Hollywood, because this film is a mess. We should stop asking Hollywood to come up with original ideas, because when they do, this is the result. 101 minutes of cliched action that checks all of the boxes - retired hit-man coming out of retirement, a boy and his dog, the perfect wife who is conveniently dead, stolen cars, Russian mobsters, a spoiled son who doesn\'t have half the restraint and judgment of dad precisely because dad spoiled him, and lots of blood.'

 ': 0\nReview: It is 5 years since the first John Wick film - one that took me by surprise by how silly it was as a narrative, but yet how well it delivered action sequences. The second film was only 2 years ago, and it raised the stakes and went from a man seeking revenge on another group of people, into one where the world was filled with assassins, popping up from everywhere all the time. I remember ending that film feeling like it had gone too far but that the third would probably do more of that. True enough, Parabellum (""prepare for war"") sees the whole world filled with assassins, and a huge administrative system around them - but yet the whole lot of them can\'t seem to cause John Wick too much trouble. As with the first film, this expands the world more than it can bear, and although it looks cool at times, the world makes no sense whatsoever and it hurts the film the more it relies on it (which it does as it expands it).'
 "": 6\nReview: Assassin John Wick is referred to as Baba Yaga in this third chapter, suggesting that he is, in fact, a supernatural being; his ability to evade death, appear and disappear like a ninja from a Godfrey Ho film, and move with lightning fast reflexes despite being in his mid-fifties confirms this fact, in my opinion. Unfortunately, Wick's invincibility means that the many action scenes in Parabellum are largely devoid of excitement, the only outcome being that Wick is still alive and all of his enemies are dead.""

 "": 8\nReview: In this 2nd installment of John Wick, the stylish visual and hard core action returns twice the level of the first film. So prepare for another suspenseful and cliffhanging sequences flow from this action movie when you watch this. The story goes deeper and the action scenes were incredibly entertaining! The revenge theme was still part of the movie's plot but this time the focus is the personal backstab of Wick. Keanu Reeves delivers again a notable performance as a titular character. This film is what a sequel movie should be - justifying the connection to the predecessor movie that made it successful by expanding its story and maintaining the elements that made it a superb film. The ending of this film opened the possibility of many more franchise of this movie.""

 ': 19\nReview: The inevitable third chapter of the JOHN WICK franchise continues on a high with the same quality as the last. In fact, this may just pip that one to the post to be the best JOHN WICK yet. The pacing is spot on and the plotting is measured by a huge amount of action sequences, all of which fizz and crackle with skill and energy. The movie hits the ground running as Keanu faces off with a hulking character in a library and then Triads in a weapon shop, but what really amazes here is the sheer inventiveness of the non-repetitive action. There are horse and motorbike chases, a Moroccan brawl with fighting dogs, alongside the massive action of the climax. There also seems to be a greater emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, featuring the likes of RAID actors and old-timer Mark Dacascos, which is a real pleasure as the choreography is top-notch. In terms of sheer enjoyment, this is a film hard to beat, and to criticise it at all is unnecessary.

 "": 20\nReview: John Wick is something special. It takes as much time setting up elaborate action sequences as it does the world with which it all takes place in. And what a world it is. It reminds me of Millers Crossing and it is cooler than any other recent attempt at noir. We are shown a criminal underworld where, if you are connected, many powerful people know who you are and show you respect. John Wick was connected but he got out. He is the rare killer who has found peace, and he is grateful for that peace. Some young kids steal that from him and he does what he does best, he wages a one man war against the Russian Mafia. It might sound like the film takes quite a leap but it all makes sense. The motives of John and the people who get in the way of his bullets are all very clear, even if it does come across as rather simple. That's the plot at it's most basic. Then there's the action. The film is directed by Reeve's stuntman from The Matrix, so this guy knows action. There are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films and their quick cuts to shame. Keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the film and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is that we have not seen him like this before. Along the way are plenty of character actors, fans of The Matrix and The Wire will recognize a few people then there are more obvious ones like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe. Everyone seems to be having a good time. That is another plus for this movie. It get's dark at times but overall it is quite fun, not very chipper, but fun. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I believe it is a must see for action fans and for anyone looking for something a bit different from the usual fare.""

When he and his dog (really the last meaningful thing he has left) fall victim to a scummy group of Russian mobsters, he emerges from his shell with vengeance on his mind. Slow and ambiguous at first, but reveals more as it goes along, and once it kicks into gear it rarely lets up with plenty of stylized, visceral action scenes, an impressive arsenal of weaponry, plus sly direction and editing that give it the feel of a violent music video at times. Preposterously fun to watch, it just doesn\'t have much of a story at its disposal, not to mention all the over-the-top bloodletting and mayhem eventually becomes redundant. Savvy, indestructible Reeves looks right at home, and delivers many of his lines with a sardonic wit. **½'

 "": 6\nReview: Assassin John Wick is referred to as Baba Yaga in this third chapter, suggesting that he is, in fact, a supernatural being; his ability to evade death, appear and disappear like a ninja from a Godfrey Ho film, and move with lightning fast reflexes despite being in his mid-fifties confirms this fact, in my opinion. Unfortunately, Wick's invincibility means that the many action scenes in Parabellum are largely devoid of excitement, the only outcome being that Wick is still alive and all of his enemies are dead.""]","John Wick is driven to take on the Russian Mafia after they attack him, beat him, destroy his belongings, kill his dog, and steal his car.

What impact did the movie John Wick have on the action genre and Keanu Reeves' career?,"["": 9\nReview: At first glance, John Wick sounds like a terrible film on paper but with the slickness of Keanu Reeves' performance as the titular character and the sheer brilliance in its action sequences, this marks the best action film of the year and one of the absolute best in the past decade. Following a brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved dog murdered by thugs from his past, John Wick vows revenge on the ones who have taken what he loves most. Like I said, on paper, this seems like a direct-to-DVD slopfest starring John Cena but as a film with Keanu Reeves as the lead, it marks the very welcomed return for Reeves to the genre. John Wick is insanely fun, violently brutal and an overall romp especially for those disappointed by The Expendables 3. John Wick is propelled by Tarantino-esque dialog mixed with the swagger of action stars from the 70s. Reeves literally emulates cool in this film and does it with such confidence, that we don't even doubt the character...even when he kills countless bad guys with extreme force in some utterly ridiculous and implausible situations. We don't doubt it for a minute. This is EXACTLY what you want out of an action film. It is briskly paced, brilliantly shot and meticulously choreographed and keeps you wanting more and more. The supporting cast filled with the likes of John Legiuzamo, Ian McShane, and Willen Dafoe also keeps this film very interesting. These guys don't play good guys, hell, John Wick by traditional standards would be a bad guy in any other film. Every character is more ruthless than the next and pushes John Wick to be more ruthless than they are, creating a very cool dynamic between the character and the plot regarding the idea of how far is too far? However, don't expect some revelation from John Wick regarding the morality of bad and evil. This film wants you entertained and does so with brute force, it never lets up, not even for a second. One scene in particular that will have your blood pumping is a showdown between thugs and Wick in a nightclub. This action sequence remains the best in the film and will have you grasping your theater seat because of the sheer intensity of it. Overall, John Wick is slick, violent fun that turns into a remarkable, surprising film that will catch you off guard. It is THAT good. I highly recommend this film to action buffs especially but I'm sure those who just like a good movie will love it as well.""
 "": 7\nReview: John Wick (2014) is the best revenge flick from Keanu Reeves of 2014 from The Matrix (1999) to John Wick (2014) another action fast paced, Entertaining slick action packed film, which kind I have never seen before. It is a very fun, straightforward action movie with an 80's sensibility. It's nice to see Keanu doing these types of roles again. It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves movies. Keanu Reeves is a bad ass what a great action packed blood packed film. Movies should really learn from this on how to make a decent action film, especially with the crap we are getting today like escape plan bullet to the head and such. This film to me is the greatest action film to come out in this century. Keanu was phenomenal the action was so fast paced and exciting my jaw literally dropped as Keanu took out all the bad guys! I personally think this film is better then all Taken films combined. It was simply brilliant, it was made for 20 million dollars and I am glad it made 40 million in the US. I think this film deserved to make 100 million!""

 "": 20\nReview: John Wick is something special. It takes as much time setting up elaborate action sequences as it does the world with which it all takes place in. And what a world it is. It reminds me of Millers Crossing and it is cooler than any other recent attempt at noir. We are shown a criminal underworld where, if you are connected, many powerful people know who you are and show you respect. John Wick was connected but he got out. He is the rare killer who has found peace, and he is grateful for that peace. Some young kids steal that from him and he does what he does best, he wages a one man war against the Russian Mafia. It might sound like the film takes quite a leap but it all makes sense. The motives of John and the people who get in the way of his bullets are all very clear, even if it does come across as rather simple. That's the plot at it's most basic. Then there's the action. The film is directed by Reeve's stuntman from The Matrix, so this guy knows action. There are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films and their quick cuts to shame. Keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the film and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is that we have not seen him like this before. Along the way are plenty of character actors, fans of The Matrix and The Wire will recognize a few people then there are more obvious ones like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe. Everyone seems to be having a good time. That is another plus for this movie. It get's dark at times but overall it is quite fun, not very chipper, but fun. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I believe it is a must see for action fans and for anyone looking for something a bit different from the usual fare.""
 "": 6\nReview: In 2014, a Keanu Reeves revenge thriller John Wick became a surprise hit. I originally skipped out on the film as I felt that the trailers only showed an assassin story that I felt I've seen before. As far as I'm concerned, I made a big mistake. Before seeing the sequel, I felt it was important to watch the first one. I rented it on Amazon Prime and I was shock by what I saw; a dark, stylish, and fun action movie that is doing it's own thing. Though I've seen plenty stories about revenge (The Count of Monte Cristo and Moby Dick being the prime examples), I can't recall one over someone's pet being murdered.""
 ': 17\nReview: There are actually quite a handful reasons why ""John Wick"" could have become a failure. The two directors have never made a film before and almost exclusively worked in the stunt department so far. The writer is not exactly experienced either. Lead actor Keanu Reeves usually scores more through boyish charm than through realistic portrayal of gritty badass characters. And the genre of crime action thrillers rarely delivers in terms of real significance. Still it became a very good film. The main reason for that is probably that it does not attempt to be anything of great cinematic value, does not try to teach groundbreaking stories on moral, loyalty or betrayal. Instead, Derek Kolstad\'s script goes for a gutsy revenge thriller that is not even hurt by its occasional predictability.'

The revenge theme was still part of the movie's plot but this time the focus is the personal backstab of Wick. Keanu Reeves delivers again a notable performance as a titular character. This film is what a sequel movie should be - justifying the connection to the predecessor movie that made it successful by expanding its story and maintaining the elements that made it a superb film.

 ': 9\nReview: ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is an American movie from this year (2017). Experienced visual effects artist Stahelski and Kolstad returned from the very first Wick film to work on the script/direction here too, so the premise with regard to people working behind the camera is there. And in front of the camera we see familiar faces again, people that survived the film, like most of all Keanu Reeves playing the central character. This is a really long film at over 2 hours and at this runtime, it is considerably longer than the first. And there is a lot other stuff different compared to the original. Most has to do with the fun component. I think the first film was a great fun watch from start to finish while offering emotion nonetheless and also delivering in the crime and drama genres. And action too, but I don\'t care too much about that. This genre is also basically the only one where this new movie delivers as the first 30 minutes are truly packed with action. It gets less afterward, but there is no denying that it was still all about the action and nothing else.'

 ': 0\nReview: It is 5 years since the first John Wick film - one that took me by surprise by how silly it was as a narrative, but yet how well it delivered action sequences. The second film was only 2 years ago, and it raised the stakes and went from a man seeking revenge on another group of people, into one where the world was filled with assassins, popping up from everywhere all the time. I remember ending that film feeling like it had gone too far but that the third would probably do more of that. True enough, Parabellum (""prepare for war"") sees the whole world filled with assassins, and a huge administrative system around them - but yet the whole lot of them can\'t seem to cause John Wick too much trouble. As with the first film, this expands the world more than it can bear, and although it looks cool at times, the world makes no sense whatsoever and it hurts the film the more it relies on it (which it does as it expands it).'

 ': 19\nReview: The inevitable third chapter of the JOHN WICK franchise continues on a high with the same quality as the last. In fact, this may just pip that one to the post to be the best JOHN WICK yet. The pacing is spot on and the plotting is measured by a huge amount of action sequences, all of which fizz and crackle with skill and energy. The movie hits the ground running as Keanu faces off with a hulking character in a library and then Triads in a weapon shop, but what really amazes here is the sheer inventiveness of the non-repetitive action. There are horse and motorbike chases, a Moroccan brawl with fighting dogs, alongside the massive action of the climax. There also seems to be a greater emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, featuring the likes of RAID actors and old-timer Mark Dacascos, which is a real pleasure as the choreography is top-notch. In terms of sheer enjoyment, this is a film hard to beat, and to criticise it at all is unnecessary. Bring on the fourth!'

It reminds me of Millers Crossing and it is cooler than any other recent attempt at noir. We are shown a criminal underworld where, if you are connected, many powerful people know who you are and show you respect. John Wick was connected but he got out. He is the rare killer who has found peace, and he is grateful for that peace. Some young kids steal that from him and he does what he does best, he wages a one man war against the Russian Mafia. It might sound like the film takes quite a leap but it all makes sense. The motives of John and the people who get in the way of his bullets are all very clear, even if it does come across as rather simple. That's the plot at it's most basic. Then there's the action. The film is directed by Reeve's stuntman from The Matrix, so this guy knows action. There are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films and their quick cuts to shame. Keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the film and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is that we have not seen him like this before. Along the way are plenty of character actors, fans of The Matrix and The Wire will recognize a few people then there are more obvious ones like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe. Everyone seems to be having a good time. That is another plus for this movie. It get's dark at times but overall it is quite fun, not very chipper, but fun. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I believe it is a must see for action fans and for anyone looking for something a bit different from the usual fare.""
 "": 14\nReview: By now you know what to expect from a John Wick movie. I thought the franchise was losing a little momentum in chapter 3 so I was worried this could be disappointing. It's not. It's even more on steroids than any Wick before! Even close to 3 hours it doesn't feel to long which is very special for a action movie. This franchise has set new standards. If anybody says a movie is good like John Wick, it better f'n be! The set pieces as everyone mentioned before are really insane this time. The Tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. The only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub, eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club, but then again it's a shady nightclub for high table people. If you liked the first three movies, get your ass to the cinema. Yeah.""
 "": 19\nReview: John Wick: Chapter 4 picks up where Chapter 3: Parabellum left off. As has been the tradition in the sequels to this beloved martial arts action franchise the action starts from the very inception of the film's opening, and lasts until the curtain falls. JW4 is no exception to that rule. What it does do is improve on the prior installment, and solidify Keanu Reeves as the greatest martial arts action star of all time. If you don't accept that notion, then you must accept the fact that it solidifies Reeves and Director, Chad Stahelski, as the greatest martial arts action pairing of modern times.""
 "": 18\nReview: Ever since the original John Wick, the franchise has set a standard of what action in Hollywood should be. Thanks to Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeve's knowledge of the technical aspects of shooting action, they've been able to deliver expertly choreographed, shot, and edited action films that are now the go to as examples of great action filmmaking. And so, the expectations for the fourth film were fairly high, especially as it became more apparent this was not only the culmination of everything before it, but a whopping 169 minutes long. Rest assured, however, that it delivers in spades. Everything we have come to know and love is here, but with an infusion of creativity like we haven't seen from the franchise yet.""]","A notable aspect of the action sequences in John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum is the sheer inventiveness and non-repetitive nature of the action scenes. The movie features various action sequences like horse and motorbike chases, a Moroccan brawl with fighting dogs, and a massive climax, all of which are skillfully crafted and full of energy. Additionally, there is a greater emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, featuring actors from RAID and Mark Dacascos, with top-notch choreography, making the action sequences stand out in the film.","The action sequences in John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum are beautifully clean and well-executed, showcasing the consequences of John's actions and further exploring the world of assassination.",0.8552579364972458,1.0,3.101930618286133,4225
"What is the genre and main actor of the film ""John Wick""?","["": 9\nReview: At first glance, John Wick sounds like a terrible film on paper but with the slickness of Keanu Reeves' performance as the titular character and the sheer brilliance in its action sequences, this marks the best action film of the year and one of the absolute best in the past decade. Following a brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved dog murdered by thugs from his past, John Wick vows revenge on the ones who have taken what he loves most. Like I said, on paper, this seems like a direct-to-DVD slopfest starring John Cena but as a film with Keanu Reeves as the lead, it marks the very welcomed return for Reeves to the genre. John Wick is insanely fun, violently brutal and an overall romp especially for those disappointed by The Expendables 3. John Wick is propelled by Tarantino-esque dialog mixed with the swagger of action stars from the 70s. Reeves literally emulates cool in this film and does it with such confidence, that we don't even doubt the character...even when he kills countless bad guys with extreme force in some utterly ridiculous and implausible situations. We don't doubt it for a minute. This is EXACTLY what you want out of an action film. It is briskly paced, brilliantly shot and meticulously choreographed and keeps you wanting more and more. The supporting cast filled with the likes of John Legiuzamo, Ian McShane, and Willen Dafoe also keeps this film very interesting. These guys don't play good guys, hell, John Wick by traditional standards would be a bad guy in any other film. Every character is more ruthless than the next and pushes John Wick to be more ruthless than they are, creating a very cool dynamic between the character and the plot regarding the idea of how far is too far? However, don't expect some revelation from John Wick regarding the morality of bad and evil. This film wants you entertained and does so with brute force, it never lets up, not even for a second. One scene in particular that will have your blood pumping is a showdown between thugs and Wick in a nightclub. This action sequence remains the best in the film and will have you grasping your theater seat because of the sheer intensity of it. Overall, John Wick is slick, violent fun that turns into a remarkable, surprising film that will catch you off guard. It is THAT good. I highly recommend this film to action buffs especially but I'm sure those who just like a good movie will love it as well.""

 ': 9\nReview: ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is an American movie from this year (2017). Experienced visual effects artist Stahelski and Kolstad returned from the very first Wick film to work on the script/direction here too, so the premise with regard to people working behind the camera is there. And in front of the camera we see familiar faces again, people that survived the film, like most of all Keanu Reeves playing the central character. This is a really long film at over 2 hours and at this runtime, it is considerably longer than the first. And there is a lot other stuff different compared to the original. Most has to do with the fun component. I think the first film was a great fun watch from start to finish while offering emotion nonetheless and also delivering in the crime and drama genres. And action too, but I don\'t care too much about that. This genre is also basically the only one where this new movie delivers as the first 30 minutes are truly packed with action. It gets less afterward, but there is no denying that it was still all about the action and nothing else.'
 ': 3\nReview: John wick has a very simple revenge story. It can be summarized as ""Keanu gets angry and shoots bad guys"" but what makes it special? Directed by Chad Stahelski who\'s a stunt specialist boy does it show because the main selling point in the film are some real virtuoso action sequences, well made choreographies. Unlike today\'s action movies, it doesn\'t use quick-cuts or shaky cameras actually see what\'s going on.'

 ': 17\nReview: There are actually quite a handful reasons why ""John Wick"" could have become a failure. The two directors have never made a film before and almost exclusively worked in the stunt department so far. The writer is not exactly experienced either. Lead actor Keanu Reeves usually scores more through boyish charm than through realistic portrayal of gritty badass characters. And the genre of crime action thrillers rarely delivers in terms of real significance. Still it became a very good film. The main reason for that is probably that it does not attempt to be anything of great cinematic value, does not try to teach groundbreaking stories on moral, loyalty or betrayal. Instead, Derek Kolstad\'s script goes for a gutsy revenge thriller that is not even hurt by its occasional predictability.'

The second film was only 2 years ago, and it raised the stakes and went from a man seeking revenge on another group of people, into one where the world was filled with assassins, popping up from everywhere all the time. I remember ending that film feeling like it had gone too far but that the third would probably do more of that. True enough, Parabellum (""prepare for war"") sees the whole world filled with assassins, and a huge administrative system around them - but yet the whole lot of them can\'t seem to cause John Wick too much trouble. As with the first film, this expands the world more than it can bear, and although it looks cool at times, the world makes no sense whatsoever and it hurts the film the more it relies on it (which it does as it expands it).'

 ': 17\nReview: There are actually quite a handful reasons why ""John Wick"" could have become a failure. The two directors have never made a film before and almost exclusively worked in the stunt department so far. The writer is not exactly experienced either. Lead actor Keanu Reeves usually scores more through boyish charm than through realistic portrayal of gritty badass characters. And the genre of crime action thrillers rarely delivers in terms of real significance. Still it became a very good film. The main reason for that is probably that it does not attempt to be anything of great cinematic value, does not try to teach groundbreaking stories on moral, loyalty or betrayal. Instead, Derek Kolstad\'s script goes for a gutsy revenge thriller that is not even hurt by its occasional predictability.'

That's essentially the plot of the movie. John Wick (Reeves) is out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him. It's a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action movies get convoluted, they get bad i.e. A Good Day to Die Hard.

 ': 4\nReview: Though he no longer has a taste for wet work, retired assassin and ""Boogeyman"" John Wick has suffered a personal tragedy that\'s left a huge void in his life. When he and his dog (really the last meaningful thing he has left) fall victim to a scummy group of Russian mobsters, he emerges from his shell with vengeance on his mind. Slow and ambiguous at first, but reveals more as it goes along, and once it kicks into gear it rarely lets up with plenty of stylized, visceral action scenes, an impressive arsenal of weaponry, plus sly direction and editing that give it the feel of a violent music video at times. Preposterously fun to watch, it just doesn\'t have much of a story at its disposal, not to mention all the over-the-top bloodletting and mayhem eventually becomes redundant. Savvy, indestructible Reeves looks right at home, and delivers many of his lines with a sardonic wit. **½'

 ': 0\nReview: No doubt about it, ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is a slick action thriller, but man, oh man, how can any one person absorb that kind of punishment? John (Keanu Reeves) gets shot, stabbed and hit by cars multiple times and postures a limp now and then to indicate he might have gotten just a little bit hurt. Besides that, he almost never makes a wrong move when hunted by dozens of assassins all at the same time. Okay, I get it, Reeves is the star of the picture and has to come out on top, but I\'d like a little more credibility put into these kinds of stories. But I guess that\'s the whole point, suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours and just go with all of the over the top action the film makers can put together.'

 "": 9\nReview: At first glance, John Wick sounds like a terrible film on paper but with the slickness of Keanu Reeves' performance as the titular character and the sheer brilliance in its action sequences, this marks the best action film of the year and one of the absolute best in the past decade. Following a brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved dog murdered by thugs from his past, John Wick vows revenge on the ones who have taken what he loves most. Like I said, on paper, this seems like a direct-to-DVD slopfest starring John Cena but as a film with Keanu Reeves as the lead, it marks the very welcomed return for Reeves to the genre. John Wick is insanely fun, violently brutal and an overall romp especially for those disappointed by The Expendables 3. John Wick is propelled by Tarantino-esque dialog mixed with the swagger of action stars from the 70s. Reeves literally emulates cool in this film and does it with such confidence, that we don't even doubt the character...even when he kills countless bad guys with extreme force in some utterly ridiculous and implausible situations. We don't doubt it for a minute. This is EXACTLY what you want out of an action film. It is briskly paced, brilliantly shot and meticulously choreographed and keeps you wanting more and more. The supporting cast filled with the likes of John Legiuzamo, Ian McShane, and Willen Dafoe also keeps this film very interesting. These guys don't play good guys, hell, John Wick by traditional standards would be a bad guy in any other film. Every character is more ruthless than the next and pushes John Wick to be more ruthless than they are, creating a very cool dynamic between the character and the plot regarding the idea of how far is too far? However, don't expect some revelation from John Wick regarding the morality of bad and evil. This film wants you entertained and does so with brute force, it never lets up, not even for a second. One scene in particular that will have your blood pumping is a showdown between thugs and Wick in a nightclub. This action sequence remains the best in the film and will have you grasping your theater seat because of the sheer intensity of it. Overall, John Wick is slick, violent fun that turns into a remarkable, surprising film that will catch you off guard. It is THAT good. I highly recommend this film to action buffs especially but I'm sure those who just like a good movie will love it as well.""
 "": 20\nReview: John Wick is something special. It takes as much time setting up elaborate action sequences as it does the world with which it all takes place in. And what a world it is. It reminds me of Millers Crossing and it is cooler than any other recent attempt at noir. We are shown a criminal underworld where, if you are connected, many powerful people know who you are and show you respect. John Wick was connected but he got out. He is the rare killer who has found peace, and he is grateful for that peace. Some young kids steal that from him and he does what he does best, he wages a one man war against the Russian Mafia. It might sound like the film takes quite a leap but it all makes sense. The motives of John and the people who get in the way of his bullets are all very clear, even if it does come across as rather simple. That's the plot at it's most basic. Then there's the action. The film is directed by Reeve's stuntman from The Matrix, so this guy knows action. There are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films and their quick cuts to shame. Keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the film and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is that we have not seen him like this before. Along the way are plenty of character actors, fans of The Matrix and The Wire will recognize a few people then there are more obvious ones like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe. Everyone seems to be having a good time. That is another plus for this movie. It get's dark at times but overall it is quite fun, not very chipper, but fun. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I believe it is a must see for action fans and for anyone looking for something a bit different from the usual fare.""

 ': 0\nReview: It is 5 years since the first John Wick film - one that took me by surprise by how silly it was as a narrative, but yet how well it delivered action sequences. The second film was only 2 years ago, and it raised the stakes and went from a man seeking revenge on another group of people, into one where the world was filled with assassins, popping up from everywhere all the time. I remember ending that film feeling like it had gone too far but that the third would probably do more of that. True enough, Parabellum (""prepare for war"") sees the whole world filled with assassins, and a huge administrative system around them - but yet the whole lot of them can\'t seem to cause John Wick too much trouble. As with the first film, this expands the world more than it can bear, and although it looks cool at times, the world makes no sense whatsoever and it hurts the film the more it relies on it (which it does as it expands it).'
 "": 8\nReview: In this 2nd installment of John Wick, the stylish visual and hard core action returns twice the level of the first film. So prepare for another suspenseful and cliffhanging sequences flow from this action movie when you watch this. The story goes deeper and the action scenes were incredibly entertaining! The revenge theme was still part of the movie's plot but this time the focus is the personal backstab of Wick. Keanu Reeves delivers again a notable performance as a titular character. This film is what a sequel movie should be - justifying the connection to the predecessor movie that made it successful by expanding its story and maintaining the elements that made it a superb film. The ending of this film opened the possibility of many more franchise of this movie.""
 ': 9\nReview: ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is an American movie from this year (2017). Experienced visual effects artist Stahelski and Kolstad returned from the very first Wick film to work on the script/direction here too, so the premise with regard to people working behind the camera is there. And in front of the camera we see familiar faces again, people that survived the film, like most of all Keanu Reeves playing the central character. This is a really long film at over 2 hours and at this runtime, it is considerably longer than the first. And there is a lot other stuff different compared to the original. Most has to do with the fun component. I think the first film was a great fun watch from start to finish while offering emotion nonetheless and also delivering in the crime and drama genres. And action too, but I don\'t care too much about that. This genre is also basically the only one where this new movie delivers as the first 30 minutes are truly packed with action. It gets less afterward, but there is no denying that it was still all about the action and nothing else.'
 ': 2\nReview: The first three John Wick films came in fairly quick succession, with only five years between the first and third chapters, each film trying to top the one before in terms of wild set pieces.

 "": 20\nReview: John Wick is something special. It takes as much time setting up elaborate action sequences as it does the world with which it all takes place in. And what a world it is. It reminds me of Millers Crossing and it is cooler than any other recent attempt at noir. We are shown a criminal underworld where, if you are connected, many powerful people know who you are and show you respect. John Wick was connected but he got out. He is the rare killer who has found peace, and he is grateful for that peace. Some young kids steal that from him and he does what he does best, he wages a one man war against the Russian Mafia. It might sound like the film takes quite a leap but it all makes sense. The motives of John and the people who get in the way of his bullets are all very clear, even if it does come across as rather simple. That's the plot at it's most basic. Then there's the action. The film is directed by Reeve's stuntman from The Matrix, so this guy knows action. There are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films and their quick cuts to shame. Keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the film and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is that we have not seen him like this before. Along the way are plenty of character actors, fans of The Matrix and The Wire will recognize a few people then there are more obvious ones like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe. Everyone seems to be having a good time. That is another plus for this movie. It get's dark at times but overall it is quite fun, not very chipper, but fun. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I believe it is a must see for action fans and for anyone looking for something a bit different from the usual fare.""
 ': 9\nReview: ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is an American movie from this year (2017). Experienced visual effects artist Stahelski and Kolstad returned from the very first Wick film to work on the script/direction here too, so the premise with regard to people working behind the camera is there. And in front of the camera we see familiar faces again, people that survived the film, like most of all Keanu Reeves playing the central character. This is a really long film at over 2 hours and at this runtime, it is considerably longer than the first. And there is a lot other stuff different compared to the original. Most has to do with the fun component. I think the first film was a great fun watch from start to finish while offering emotion nonetheless and also delivering in the crime and drama genres. And action too, but I don\'t care too much about that. This genre is also basically the only one where this new movie delivers as the first 30 minutes are truly packed with action.

 ': 0\nReview: It is 5 years since the first John Wick film - one that took me by surprise by how silly it was as a narrative, but yet how well it delivered action sequences. The second film was only 2 years ago, and it raised the stakes and went from a man seeking revenge on another group of people, into one where the world was filled with assassins, popping up from everywhere all the time. I remember ending that film feeling like it had gone too far but that the third would probably do more of that. True enough, Parabellum (""prepare for war"") sees the whole world filled with assassins, and a huge administrative system around them - but yet the whole lot of them can\'t seem to cause John Wick too much trouble. As with the first film, this expands the world more than it can bear, and although it looks cool at times, the world makes no sense whatsoever and it hurts the film the more it relies on it (which it does as it expands it).'

 "": 0\nReview: The best way I can describe John Wick is to picture Taken but instead of Liam Neeson it's Keanu Reeves and instead of his daughter it's his dog. That's essentially the plot of the movie. John Wick (Reeves) is out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him. It's a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action movies get convoluted, they get bad i.e. A Good Day to Die Hard. John Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. John Wick succeeds in its simplicity.""
 "": 9\nReview: At first glance, John Wick sounds like a terrible film on paper but with the slickness of Keanu Reeves' performance as the titular character and the sheer brilliance in its action sequences, this marks the best action film of the year and one of the absolute best in the past decade. Following a brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved dog murdered by thugs from his past, John Wick vows revenge on the ones who have taken what he loves most. Like I said, on paper, this seems like a direct-to-DVD slopfest starring John Cena but as a film with Keanu Reeves as the lead, it marks the very welcomed return for Reeves to the genre. John Wick is insanely fun, violently brutal and an overall romp especially for those disappointed by The Expendables 3. John Wick is propelled by Tarantino-esque dialog mixed with the swagger of action stars from the 70s. Reeves literally emulates cool in this film and does it with such confidence, that we don't even doubt the character...even when he kills countless bad guys with extreme force in some utterly ridiculous and implausible situations. We don't doubt it for a minute. This is EXACTLY what you want out of an action film. It is briskly paced, brilliantly shot and meticulously choreographed and keeps you wanting more and more. The supporting cast filled with the likes of John Legiuzamo, Ian McShane, and Willen Dafoe also keeps this film very interesting. These guys don't play good guys, hell, John Wick by traditional standards would be a bad guy in any other film. Every character is more ruthless than the next and pushes John Wick to be more ruthless than they are, creating a very cool dynamic between the character and the plot regarding the idea of how far is too far? However, don't expect some revelation from John Wick regarding the morality of bad and evil. This film wants you entertained and does so with brute force, it never lets up, not even for a second. One scene in particular that will have your blood pumping is a showdown between thugs and Wick in a nightclub. This action sequence remains the best in the film and will have you grasping your theater seat because of the sheer intensity of it. Overall, John Wick is slick, violent fun that turns into a remarkable, surprising film that will catch you off guard. It is THAT good. I highly recommend this film to action buffs especially but I'm sure those who just like a good movie will love it as well.""

 "": 10\nReview: The first John Wick film took me by surprise; it was a cartoonish action film that was surprisingly brutal in its content, cruel in its delivery, and had a real punch to it. All of it existed inside a world that convinced in its own logic, even if it was clearly fantasy. John Wick 2 doesn't have the ability to sneak up on me unannounced, which does work against it, but this is not what hurts it the most.""
 "": 11\nReview: JOHN WICK is a rare example of Hollywood getting things spot-on when it comes to creating the near-perfect action film. JOHN WICK is a relentless, pulse-pounding thriller that has plenty of similarity to the Liam Neeson classic TAKEN, albeit with a more simplistic (and also more emotionally intense) plot line. This is the kind of lean, pared-down film-making that's all about intensity and momentum. It sits well with classic international fare like POINT BLANK, SLEEPLESS NIGHT, MEA CULPA, THE MAN FROM NOWHERE, and THE RAID films.""
 "": 8\nReview: In this 2nd installment of John Wick, the stylish visual and hard core action returns twice the level of the first film. So prepare for another suspenseful and cliffhanging sequences flow from this action movie when you watch this. The story goes deeper and the action scenes were incredibly entertaining! The revenge theme was still part of the movie's plot but this time the focus is the personal backstab of Wick. Keanu Reeves delivers again a notable performance as a titular character. This film is what a sequel movie should be - justifying the connection to the predecessor movie that made it successful by expanding its story and maintaining the elements that made it a superb film. The ending of this film opened the possibility of many more franchise of this movie.""

 "": 14\nReview: By now you know what to expect from a John Wick movie. I thought the franchise was losing a little momentum in chapter 3 so I was worried this could be disappointing. It's not. It's even more on steroids than any Wick before! Even close to 3 hours it doesn't feel to long which is very special for a action movie. This franchise has set new standards. If anybody says a movie is good like John Wick, it better f'n be! The set pieces as everyone mentioned before are really insane this time. The Tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. The only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub, eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club, but then again it's a shady nightclub for high table people. If you liked the first three movies, get your ass to the cinema. Yeah.""

 "": 18\nReview: Ever since the original John Wick, the franchise has set a standard of what action in Hollywood should be. Thanks to Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeve's knowledge of the technical aspects of shooting action, they've been able to deliver expertly choreographed, shot, and edited action films that are now the go to as examples of great action filmmaking. And so, the expectations for the fourth film were fairly high, especially as it became more apparent this was not only the culmination of everything before it, but a whopping 169 minutes long. Rest assured, however, that it delivers in spades. Everything we have come to know and love is here, but with an infusion of creativity like we haven't seen from the franchise yet.""
 ': 19\nReview: The inevitable third chapter of the JOHN WICK franchise continues on a high with the same quality as the last. In fact, this may just pip that one to the post to be the best JOHN WICK yet. The pacing is spot on and the plotting is measured by a huge amount of action sequences, all of which fizz and crackle with skill and energy. The movie hits the ground running as Keanu faces off with a hulking character in a library and then Triads in a weapon shop, but what really amazes here is the sheer inventiveness of the non-repetitive action. There are horse and motorbike chases, a Moroccan brawl with fighting dogs, alongside the massive action of the climax. There also seems to be a greater emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, featuring the likes of RAID actors and old-timer Mark Dacascos, which is a real pleasure as the choreography is top-notch. In terms of sheer enjoyment, this is a film hard to beat, and to criticise it at all is unnecessary. Bring on the fourth!'

The motives of John and the people who get in the way of his bullets are all very clear, even if it does come across as rather simple. That's the plot at it's most basic. Then there's the action. The film is directed by Reeve's stuntman from The Matrix, so this guy knows action. There are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films and their quick cuts to shame. Keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the film and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is that we have not seen him like this before. Along the way are plenty of character actors, fans of The Matrix and The Wire will recognize a few people then there are more obvious ones like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe. Everyone seems to be having a good time. That is another plus for this movie. It get's dark at times but overall it is quite fun, not very chipper, but fun. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I believe it is a must see for action fans and for anyone looking for something a bit different from the usual fare.""

 ': 9\nReview: ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is an American movie from this year (2017). Experienced visual effects artist Stahelski and Kolstad returned from the very first Wick film to work on the script/direction here too, so the premise with regard to people working behind the camera is there. And in front of the camera we see familiar faces again, people that survived the film, like most of all Keanu Reeves playing the central character. This is a really long film at over 2 hours and at this runtime, it is considerably longer than the first. And there is a lot other stuff different compared to the original. Most has to do with the fun component. I think the first film was a great fun watch from start to finish while offering emotion nonetheless and also delivering in the crime and drama genres. And action too, but I don\'t care too much about that. This genre is also basically the only one where this new movie delivers as the first 30 minutes are truly packed with action. It gets less afterward, but there is no denying that it was still all about the action and nothing else.'
 "": 10\nReview: The first John Wick film took me by surprise; it was a cartoonish action film that was surprisingly brutal in its content, cruel in its delivery, and had a real punch to it. All of it existed inside a world that convinced in its own logic, even if it was clearly fantasy. John Wick 2 doesn't have the ability to sneak up on me unannounced, which does work against it, but this is not what hurts it the most.""
 "": 23\nReview: I love me a bit of the old ultra-violence, but I also like a plot of some kind to go with all of the gunfire, blood and broken bones. Failing that, the gory mayhem had better be something special - something that breaks new ground in terms of action cinema. John Wick Chapter 2 is relentlessly violent, Keanu Reeves' eponymous hitman laying waste to almost everyone he crosses paths with, once again finishing most victims with a shot to the head, but the action is simply more of the same, director Chad Stahelski bringing nothing new to the table.""
 "": 0\nReview: The best way I can describe John Wick is to picture Taken but instead of Liam Neeson it's Keanu Reeves and instead of his daughter it's his dog. That's essentially the plot of the movie. John Wick (Reeves) is out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him. It's a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action movies get convoluted, they get bad i.e. A Good Day to Die Hard. John Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. John Wick succeeds in its simplicity.""
 "": 11\nReview: JOHN WICK is a rare example of Hollywood getting things spot-on when it comes to creating the near-perfect action film. JOHN WICK is a relentless, pulse-pounding thriller that has plenty of similarity to the Liam Neeson classic TAKEN, albeit with a more simplistic (and also more emotionally intense) plot line. This is the kind of lean, pared-down film-making that's all about intensity and momentum. It sits well with classic international fare like POINT BLANK, SLEEPLESS NIGHT, MEA CULPA, THE MAN FROM NOWHERE, and THE RAID films.""

 ': 0\nReview: It is 5 years since the first John Wick film - one that took me by surprise by how silly it was as a narrative, but yet how well it delivered action sequences. The second film was only 2 years ago, and it raised the stakes and went from a man seeking revenge on another group of people, into one where the world was filled with assassins, popping up from everywhere all the time. I remember ending that film feeling like it had gone too far but that the third would probably do more of that. True enough, Parabellum (""prepare for war"") sees the whole world filled with assassins, and a huge administrative system around them - but yet the whole lot of them can\'t seem to cause John Wick too much trouble. As with the first film, this expands the world more than it can bear, and although it looks cool at times, the world makes no sense whatsoever and it hurts the film the more it relies on it (which it does as it expands it).'

 "": 9\nReview: At first glance, John Wick sounds like a terrible film on paper but with the slickness of Keanu Reeves' performance as the titular character and the sheer brilliance in its action sequences, this marks the best action film of the year and one of the absolute best in the past decade. Following a brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved dog murdered by thugs from his past, John Wick vows revenge on the ones who have taken what he loves most. Like I said, on paper, this seems like a direct-to-DVD slopfest starring John Cena but as a film with Keanu Reeves as the lead, it marks the very welcomed return for Reeves to the genre. John Wick is insanely fun, violently brutal and an overall romp especially for those disappointed by The Expendables 3. John Wick is propelled by Tarantino-esque dialog mixed with the swagger of action stars from the 70s. Reeves literally emulates cool in this film and does it with such confidence, that we don't even doubt the character...even when he kills countless bad guys with extreme force in some utterly ridiculous and implausible situations. We don't doubt it for a minute. This is EXACTLY what you want out of an action film. It is briskly paced, brilliantly shot and meticulously choreographed and keeps you wanting more and more. The supporting cast filled with the likes of John Legiuzamo, Ian McShane, and Willen Dafoe also keeps this film very interesting. These guys don't play good guys, hell, John Wick by traditional standards would be a bad guy in any other film. Every character is more ruthless than the next and pushes John Wick to be more ruthless than they are, creating a very cool dynamic between the character and the plot regarding the idea of how far is too far? However, don't expect some revelation from John Wick regarding the morality of bad and evil. This film wants you entertained and does so with brute force, it never lets up, not even for a second. One scene in particular that will have your blood pumping is a showdown between thugs and Wick in a nightclub. This action sequence remains the best in the film and will have you grasping your theater seat because of the sheer intensity of it. Overall, John Wick is slick, violent fun that turns into a remarkable, surprising film that will catch you off guard. It is THAT good. I highly recommend this film to action buffs especially but I'm sure those who just like a good movie will love it as well.""

Movies should really learn from this on how to make a decent action film, especially with the crap we are getting today like escape plan bullet to the head and such. This film to me is the greatest action film to come out in this century. Keanu was phenomenal the action was so fast paced and exciting my jaw literally dropped as Keanu took out all the bad guys!

They did this not knowing who he was; they just wanted the car. Now John Wick is out for revenge and the Russian gangster is trying to save his son's life by sending killers after John.""
 ': 9\nReview: ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is an American movie from this year (2017). Experienced visual effects artist Stahelski and Kolstad returned from the very first Wick film to work on the script/direction here too, so the premise with regard to people working behind the camera is there. And in front of the camera we see familiar faces again, people that survived the film, like most of all Keanu Reeves playing the central character. This is a really long film at over 2 hours and at this runtime, it is considerably longer than the first. And there is a lot other stuff different compared to the original. Most has to do with the fun component. I think the first film was a great fun watch from start to finish while offering emotion nonetheless and also delivering in the crime and drama genres. And action too, but I don\'t care too much about that. This genre is also basically the only one where this new movie delivers as the first 30 minutes are truly packed with action. It gets less afterward, but there is no denying that it was still all about the action and nothing else.'
 "": 18\nReview: Ever since the original John Wick, the franchise has set a standard of what action in Hollywood should be. Thanks to Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeve's knowledge of the technical aspects of shooting action, they've been able to deliver expertly choreographed, shot, and edited action films that are now the go to as examples of great action filmmaking. And so, the expectations for the fourth film were fairly high, especially as it became more apparent this was not only the culmination of everything before it, but a whopping 169 minutes long. Rest assured, however, that it delivers in spades. Everything we have come to know and love is here, but with an infusion of creativity like we haven't seen from the franchise yet.""
 ': 19\nReview: The inevitable third chapter of the JOHN WICK franchise continues on a high with the same quality as the last. In fact, this may just pip that one to the post to be the best JOHN WICK yet. The pacing is spot on and the plotting is measured by a huge amount of action sequences, all of which fizz and crackle with skill and energy. The movie hits the ground running as Keanu faces off with a hulking character in a library and then Triads in a weapon shop, but what really amazes here is the sheer inventiveness of the non-repetitive action. There are horse and motorbike chases, a Moroccan brawl with fighting dogs, alongside the massive action of the climax. There also seems to be a greater emphasis on hand-to-hand combat, featuring the likes of RAID actors and old-timer Mark Dacascos, which is a real pleasure as the choreography is top-notch. In terms of sheer enjoyment, this is a film hard to beat, and to criticise it at all is unnecessary. Bring on the fourth!']","The surprise hit movie starring Keanu Reeves in 2014 that led to a sequel is ""John Wick.""",John Wick,0.7668128168042967,1.0,2.0320932865142822,4212

 ': 0\nReview: It is 5 years since the first John Wick film - one that took me by surprise by how silly it was as a narrative, but yet how well it delivered action sequences. The second film was only 2 years ago, and it raised the stakes and went from a man seeking revenge on another group of people, into one where the world was filled with assassins, popping up from everywhere all the time. I remember ending that film feeling like it had gone too far but that the third would probably do more of that. True enough, Parabellum (""prepare for war"") sees the whole world filled with assassins, and a huge administrative system around them - but yet the whole lot of them can\'t seem to cause John Wick too much trouble. As with the first film, this expands the world more than it can bear, and although it looks cool at times, the world makes no sense whatsoever and it hurts the film the more it relies on it (which it does as it expands it).'

Following a brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved dog murdered by thugs from his past, John Wick vows revenge on the ones who have taken what he loves most. Like I said, on paper, this seems like a direct-to-DVD slopfest starring John Cena but as a film with Keanu Reeves as the lead, it marks the very welcomed return for Reeves to the genre. John Wick is insanely fun, violently brutal and an overall romp especially for those disappointed by The Expendables 3. John Wick is propelled by Tarantino-esque dialog mixed with the swagger of action stars from the 70s. Reeves literally emulates cool in this film and does it with such confidence, that we don't even doubt the character...even when he kills countless bad guys with extreme force in some utterly ridiculous and implausible situations. We don't doubt it for a minute. This is EXACTLY what you want out of an action film. It is briskly paced, brilliantly shot and meticulously choreographed and keeps you wanting more and more. The supporting cast filled with the likes of John Legiuzamo, Ian McShane, and Willen Dafoe also keeps this film very interesting. These guys don't play good guys, hell, John Wick by traditional standards would be a bad guy in any other film. Every character is more ruthless than the next and pushes John Wick to be more ruthless than they are, creating a very cool dynamic between the character and the plot regarding the idea of how far is too far? However, don't expect some revelation from John Wick regarding the morality of bad and evil. This film wants you entertained and does so with brute force, it never lets up, not even for a second. One scene in particular that will have your blood pumping is a showdown between thugs and Wick in a nightclub. This action sequence remains the best in the film and will have you grasping your theater seat because of the sheer intensity of it. Overall, John Wick is slick, violent fun that turns into a remarkable, surprising film that will catch you off guard. It is THAT good. I highly recommend this film to action buffs especially but I'm sure those who just like a good movie will love it as well.""

 ': 4\nReview: Though he no longer has a taste for wet work, retired assassin and ""Boogeyman"" John Wick has suffered a personal tragedy that\'s left a huge void in his life. When he and his dog (really the last meaningful thing he has left) fall victim to a scummy group of Russian mobsters, he emerges from his shell with vengeance on his mind. Slow and ambiguous at first, but reveals more as it goes along, and once it kicks into gear it rarely lets up with plenty of stylized, visceral action scenes, an impressive arsenal of weaponry, plus sly direction and editing that give it the feel of a violent music video at times. Preposterously fun to watch, it just doesn\'t have much of a story at its disposal, not to mention all the over-the-top bloodletting and mayhem eventually becomes redundant. Savvy, indestructible Reeves looks right at home, and delivers many of his lines with a sardonic wit. **½']",John Wick faces Santino D'Antonio as he is called upon by the crime lord in the movie.,"John Wick faces deadly assassins, numerous killers, and countless thugs as he is called upon by crime lord Santino D'Antonio in the movie.",0.9674523007748848,1.0,2.391976833343506,4311

 ': 3\nReview: John wick has a very simple revenge story. It can be summarized as ""Keanu gets angry and shoots bad guys"" but what makes it special? Directed by Chad Stahelski who\'s a stunt specialist boy does it show because the main selling point in the film are some real virtuoso action sequences, well made choreographies. Unlike today\'s action movies, it doesn\'t use quick-cuts or shaky cameras actually see what\'s going on.'
 ': 17\nReview: There are actually quite a handful reasons why ""John Wick"" could have become a failure. The two directors have never made a film before and almost exclusively worked in the stunt department so far. The writer is not exactly experienced either. Lead actor Keanu Reeves usually scores more through boyish charm than through realistic portrayal of gritty badass characters. And the genre of crime action thrillers rarely delivers in terms of real significance. Still it became a very good film. The main reason for that is probably that it does not attempt to be anything of great cinematic value, does not try to teach groundbreaking stories on moral, loyalty or betrayal. Instead, Derek Kolstad\'s script goes for a gutsy revenge thriller that is not even hurt by its occasional predictability.'
 ': 9\nReview: ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is an American movie from this year (2017). Experienced visual effects artist Stahelski and Kolstad returned from the very first Wick film to work on the script/direction here too, so the premise with regard to people working behind the camera is there. And in front of the camera we see familiar faces again, people that survived the film, like most of all Keanu Reeves playing the central character. This is a really long film at over 2 hours and at this runtime, it is considerably longer than the first. And there is a lot other stuff different compared to the original. Most has to do with the fun component. I think the first film was a great fun watch from start to finish while offering emotion nonetheless and also delivering in the crime and drama genres. And action too, but I don\'t care too much about that. This genre is also basically the only one where this new movie delivers as the first 30 minutes are truly packed with action. It gets less afterward, but there is no denying that it was still all about the action and nothing else.'

It went against certain action film conventions - the hero was not a muscle bound hulk like a Schwarzenegger or Stallone, the action was super fast paced, the plot was basic and straighforward, but introduced some unique elements, and there was something a bit unique and stylish about the film.

Who handles the action in John Wick?,"["": 19\nReview: If you've seen the first John Wick movie, you know that Keanu Reeves is John Wick, a retired assassin who comes out of retirement when someone kills his dog. In this one, which begins a week later, matters are still reverberating, and some one has stolen his car, which calls for a lot of carnage. That settled, John is called on to pay off an old debt by helping Ian McShane take over the Assassin's Guild by flying around to Italy, Canada and Manhattan and killing what seems like hundreds of assassins.""
 ': 3\nReview: John wick has a very simple revenge story. It can be summarized as ""Keanu gets angry and shoots bad guys"" but what makes it special? Directed by Chad Stahelski who\'s a stunt specialist boy does it show because the main selling point in the film are some real virtuoso action sequences, well made choreographies. Unlike today\'s action movies, it doesn\'t use quick-cuts or shaky cameras actually see what\'s going on.'

 ': 4\nReview: ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" (2017 release; 122 min.) continues the \'adventures\' of former (?) hit man John Wick. As the movie opens, we are immediately thrown in the middle of a car vs. bike chase, and next thing we know, we find our man retrieving his beloved Mustang from a chop shop in NYC, but not without cars flying about, and dozens of dead or wounded bodies. And that\'s all in the pre-opening credits! As the story unfolds, Wick, who wants ""out, is nevertheless forced back ""in"" when an Italian baddie calls in a favor and Wick has no choice but to accept. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you\'ll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.'
 "": 9\nReview: At first glance, John Wick sounds like a terrible film on paper but with the slickness of Keanu Reeves' performance as the titular character and the sheer brilliance in its action sequences, this marks the best action film of the year and one of the absolute best in the past decade. Following a brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved dog murdered by thugs from his past, John Wick vows revenge on the ones who have taken what he loves most. Like I said, on paper, this seems like a direct-to-DVD slopfest starring John Cena but as a film with Keanu Reeves as the lead, it marks the very welcomed return for Reeves to the genre. John Wick is insanely fun, violently brutal and an overall romp especially for those disappointed by The Expendables 3. John Wick is propelled by Tarantino-esque dialog mixed with the swagger of action stars from the 70s. Reeves literally emulates cool in this film and does it with such confidence, that we don't even doubt the character...even when he kills countless bad guys with extreme force in some utterly ridiculous and implausible situations. We don't doubt it for a minute. This is EXACTLY what you want out of an action film. It is briskly paced, brilliantly shot and meticulously choreographed and keeps you wanting more and more. The supporting cast filled with the likes of John Legiuzamo, Ian McShane, and Willen Dafoe also keeps this film very interesting. These guys don't play good guys, hell, John Wick by traditional standards would be a bad guy in any other film. Every character is more ruthless than the next and pushes John Wick to be more ruthless than they are, creating a very cool dynamic between the character and the plot regarding the idea of how far is too far? However, don't expect some revelation from John Wick regarding the morality of bad and evil. This film wants you entertained and does so with brute force, it never lets up, not even for a second. One scene in particular that will have your blood pumping is a showdown between thugs and Wick in a nightclub. This action sequence remains the best in the film and will have you grasping your theater seat because of the sheer intensity of it. Overall, John Wick is slick, violent fun that turns into a remarkable, surprising film that will catch you off guard. It is THAT good. I highly recommend this film to action buffs especially but I'm sure those who just like a good movie will love it as well.""
 "": 0\nReview: The best way I can describe John Wick is to picture Taken but instead of Liam Neeson it's Keanu Reeves and instead of his daughter it's his dog. That's essentially the plot of the movie. John Wick (Reeves) is out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him. It's a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action movies get convoluted, they get bad i.e. A Good Day to Die Hard. John Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. John Wick succeeds in its simplicity.""
 "": 20\nReview: John Wick is something special. It takes as much time setting up elaborate action sequences as it does the world with which it all takes place in. And what a world it is. It reminds me of Millers Crossing and it is cooler than any other recent attempt at noir. We are shown a criminal underworld where, if you are connected, many powerful people know who you are and show you respect. John Wick was connected but he got out. He is the rare killer who has found peace, and he is grateful for that peace. Some young kids steal that from him and he does what he does best, he wages a one man war against the Russian Mafia. It might sound like the film takes quite a leap but it all makes sense. The motives of John and the people who get in the way of his bullets are all very clear, even if it does come across as rather simple. That's the plot at it's most basic. Then there's the action. The film is directed by Reeve's stuntman from The Matrix, so this guy knows action. There are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films and their quick cuts to shame. Keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the film and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is that we have not seen him like this before. Along the way are plenty of character actors, fans of The Matrix and The Wire will recognize a few people then there are more obvious ones like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe. Everyone seems to be having a good time. That is another plus for this movie. It get's dark at times but overall it is quite fun, not very chipper, but fun. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I believe it is a must see for action fans and for anyone looking for something a bit different from the usual fare.""
 "": 20\nReview: After resolving his issues with the Russian mafia, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) returns home. But soon the mobster Santino D'Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio) visits him to show Wick's marker and tells that he needs to help. John Wicks refuses since he is retired and Santino blows-up his house. John Wick meets the owner of the Continental hotel in New York City, Winston (Ian McShane), and he tells that Wick cannot violate the Mafia rules and shall honor the marker. Santino asks John Wick to kill his sister Gianna D'Antonio (Claudia Gerini) in Rome so that he can sit on the High Table of the criminal organizations. When John Wicks accomplishes his assignment, Santino puts a seven-million dollar contract on him attracting professional killers from everywhere. But Wick promises to kill Santino that is not protected by his marker anymore.""
 "": 18\nReview: When the story begins, John (Keanu Reeves) has just lost his wife. After her death, he's a bit lost but tries to rebuild his life. One day, he's getting gas and a young Russian-American punk notices Wick's classic car...and tries to buy it off him. But Wick isn't interested and declines. Soon, the punk arrives at Wick's home with some goons where they surprise him--beating him senseless, destroying his stuff, killing his dog and stealing his car! This is when you then learn that Wick is a super-assassin....and the punk chose the wrong guy to attack. The jerk's father is a big-time Russian mobster....and it's a contest to see who will win...the mobster and his gang or Wick on his own. Considering there are (so far) two MORE John Wick films, it pretty much seems certain who will win this battle.""
 "": 18\nReview: Ever since the original John Wick, the franchise has set a standard of what action in Hollywood should be. Thanks to Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeve's knowledge of the technical aspects of shooting action, they've been able to deliver expertly choreographed, shot, and edited action films that are now the go to as examples of great action filmmaking. And so, the expectations for the fourth film were fairly high, especially as it became more apparent this was not only the culmination of everything before it, but a whopping 169 minutes long. Rest assured, however, that it delivers in spades. Everything we have come to know and love is here, but with an infusion of creativity like we haven't seen from the franchise yet.""
 "": 16\nReview: John Wick Chapter 2 pits Keanu Reeves' titular character against the mean and nefarious of the criminal underworld. Once again, Reeves proves that he is a force to be reckoned with in this ridiculous, over-the-top sequel that is every bit as fun as the original. These types of films are rarely known for their artistic value but John Wick: Chapter 2 sets the bar pretty high, not only in its action, but in it's set design and camera work. This is pure escapist entertainment and couldn't have come at a better time. Those wanting to take a break from watching the Oscar nominees, this film is exactly what you're looking for.""
 ': 9\nReview: ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is an American movie from this year (2017). Experienced visual effects artist Stahelski and Kolstad returned from the very first Wick film to work on the script/direction here too, so the premise with regard to people working behind the camera is there. And in front of the camera we see familiar faces again, people that survived the film, like most of all Keanu Reeves playing the central character. This is a really long film at over 2 hours and at this runtime, it is considerably longer than the first. And there is a lot other stuff different compared to the original. Most has to do with the fun component. I think the first film was a great fun watch from start to finish while offering emotion nonetheless and also delivering in the crime and drama genres. And action too, but I don\'t care too much about that. This genre is also basically the only one where this new movie delivers as the first 30 minutes are truly packed with action. It gets less afterward, but there is no denying that it was still all about the action and nothing else.'
 ': 0\nReview: No doubt about it, ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" is a slick action thriller, but man, oh man, how can any one person absorb that kind of punishment? John (Keanu Reeves) gets shot, stabbed and hit by cars multiple times and postures a limp now and then to indicate he might have gotten just a little bit hurt. Besides that, he almost never makes a wrong move when hunted by dozens of assassins all at the same time. Okay, I get it, Reeves is the star of the picture and has to come out on top, but I\'d like a little more credibility put into these kinds of stories. But I guess that\'s the whole point, suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours and just go with all of the over the top action the film makers can put together.'
 ': 4\nReview: Though he no longer has a taste for wet work, retired assassin and ""Boogeyman"" John Wick has suffered a personal tragedy that\'s left a huge void in his life. When he and his dog (really the last meaningful thing he has left) fall victim to a scummy group of Russian mobsters, he emerges from his shell with vengeance on his mind. Slow and ambiguous at first, but reveals more as it goes along, and once it kicks into gear it rarely lets up with plenty of stylized, visceral action scenes, an impressive arsenal of weaponry, plus sly direction and editing that give it the feel of a violent music video at times. Preposterously fun to watch, it just doesn\'t have much of a story at its disposal, not to mention all the over-the-top bloodletting and mayhem eventually becomes redundant. Savvy, indestructible Reeves looks right at home, and delivers many of his lines with a sardonic wit. **½']",John Wick handles the action in the movie.,"Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeves are responsible for the action in the John Wick franchise, with their expertise in technical aspects of shooting action resulting in expertly choreographed, shot, and edited films that set a standard for action in Hollywood.",0.4290476190390381,1.0,1.8614704608917236,5261
